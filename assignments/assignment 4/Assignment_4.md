# Storytelling with Data Assignment 4: Tell your first (notebook-based) data story!

Note: please work through the material in [Module 4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md#module-4-data-science-tools) before beginning this assignment.

For this assignment, you'll be telling a story that seeks to answer or explore
questions related to [Vermont Department of Health data](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiMjEzYTFjZWQtN2RmYS00ZWY1LWIxYzQtN2E1YWFlOTBmNTVkIiwidCI6IjIwYjQ5MzNiLWJhYWQtNDMzYy05YzAyLTcwZWRjYzc1NTljNiJ9).  You can
choose any question and/or dataset(s) to analyze for this assignment.

Your story should be analogous to the ones you put together in [Assignment
1](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/assignments/assignment%201/Assignment_1.md)
and [Assignment
2](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/assignments/assignment%202/Assignment_2.md),
but it must be data-driven (like the story you told for Assignment 2).  You
should support your narrative with specific statistics, data visualizations,
and/or other figures that you generate in your notebook.

You may work on this assignment individually, or in groups of any size you
choose.

# Story format

You should use this [demo
project](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/tree/master/data-stories/demo)
and as a template for putting your story together.  The sample notebook contains
a recommended approach to organizing your notebook (although you may stray from
that recommended format if you feel it's necessary).  Your project should
comprise:
- A single Google Colaboratory-compatible notebook containing your (or your group's) story and code.  Name the notebook `groupname.ipynb`, where `groupname` is replaced with a unique identifier for your group (e.g., your last name and first initial, a made-up team name, etc.).
- A README file formatted using [Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).  Name the file `groupname.md` (again replacing `groupname` with the same unique identifier that you used to name your notebook).
- A YouTube video (linked to in your README file) of your story.  The precise format of your recorded story is up to you, but I suggest that you either do a narrated screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or a narrated screencast of a slideshow with figures pasted in from your notebook.

# Further resources and reading

During one of our class meetings, we will have a discussion with several
representatives from the Vermont Department of Health.  This will provide an
opportunity for the Department of Health to describe some of the issues they are
most interested in.  The discussion will also provide an opportunity for us to
engage with the representatives about relevant issues of interest to students in
the class, brainstorm potential approaches, and so on.  This part of the course
is supported by Dartmouth's [Social Impact
Practicum](https://students.dartmouth.edu/social-impact/programs-initiatives/faculty/social-impact-practicums-sips) program.
