# Project information

CEO gender pay gap
Annemarija Apine (annemarija): wrote most of the code and found data
Elisa Brosera: created the story and helped with the code
# Overview

This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences.  Specifically:
- What was your main question?
Do female CEOs outearn their male counterparts?
- How did you approach exploring and/or answering your question?
  - What data did you use?
Compustat Execucomp data on executives
  - What sorts of data science tools did you use?
Regressions, plotting tools
- What did you find or accomplish (be brief)?  For example, did you find any interesting results or insights?  Or did you solve an interesting problem that might be useful in another project?
Female CEOs appear to outearn their male counterparts only due to a lack of controls.


Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).  (Sample slides [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/modules_and_numpy.md) and [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/pandas.md).)

# Downloading the data

All data sets are available in this github folder. They are from execucomp but have been cleaned up in stata for a different project.

# Running the code

# Contributing to the code

Tell other people how they can contribute to the project you've started.  Specifically:
- What are the most obvious next steps?
Find more control variables for the data set
- What are some questions that your work raises?
Debate about ethical/clickbait reporting of research findings
- What challenges remain?
Finding and merging suitable control variables.
- Are there any known bugs or problems with your approach that someone continuing your project should be aware of?
We were not able to run a regression that would absorb firm fixed effects.

The idea to use Execucomp data set to analyse gender pay gap comes from Econ 57 class.
