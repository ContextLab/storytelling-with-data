# Project information

Name the project and list the authors and their GitHub usernames.  If the GitHub commit history of your project does not reflect each contributor's work (e.g., if a single person was nominated to pull everyone's changes into the repository), you should include a brief description of each contributor's role in the project.

# Overview

This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences.  Specifically:
- What was your main question?
- How did you approach exploring and/or answering your question?
  - What data did you use?
  - What sorts of data science tools did you use?
- What did you find or accomplish (be brief)?  For example, did you find any interesting results or insights?  Or did you solve an interesting problem that might be useful in another project?

Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here.  You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar).  You may also find [Marp](https://yhatt.github.io/marp/) useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for [Modules 1--4](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/outline.md).  (Sample slides [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/modules_and_numpy.md) and [here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data/blob/master/slides/pandas.md).)

# Downloading the data

Provide a link to the dataset(s) you're using for the project, along with a brief description of the data.

# Running the code

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.  If the project is implemented in one or more Colaboratory notebooks, you should provide a link to the notebook(s) here.  Also copy the notebooks (as .ipynb files) into your project folder so that everything related to your project is backed up on GitHub.

# Contributing to the code

Tell other people how they can contribute to the project you've started.  Specifically:
- What are the most obvious next steps?
- What are some questions that your work raises?
- What challenges remain?
- Are there any known bugs or problems with your approach that someone continuing your project should be aware of?

# Acknowledgements

If your idea is based on or inspired by someone else's work (either their code or their ideas), cite them and provide links to their work.  Also, if you received help or support from someone who is not listed as an author on this project, you should acknowledge them here.
