# Project information

Vermont 2020 Traffic Stops is a data story created by Alex Wells (on github as alexwells-22).

# Overview

Because I was pulled over for the first time in my life last December, I thought it would be interesting to examine who gets pulled over the most (i.e. - is overpoliced). I know that men tend to be considered riskier than women, so I wanted to back that assumption up with some kind of data and I thought it would be interesting to see what the age and race distributions could say about policing patterns.

This data story was created using bar and scatterplots to understand who is pulled over the most and when that happens.

This data story generally confirmed assumptions about the data it concerned and also suggests that lockdown measures are effective at limiting the number of traffic stops.

# Downloading the data

Data for this project can be found on the [Vermont Department of Public Safety website](https://vsp.vermont.gov/communityaffairs/trafficstops).

# Running the code

Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code.  If the project is implemented in one or more Colaboratory notebooks, you should provide a link to the notebook(s) here.  Also copy the notebooks (as .ipynb files) into your project folder so that everything related to your project is backed up on GitHub.

# Contributing to the code

This data story did not produce the conclusions that I might have expected. While data exists to make more concrete assertions about the fairness of policing practices in Vermont, the connection between COVID restrictions and the number of traffic stops was beautifully apparent and was worth exploring. This data story could be continued by increasing the temporal resolution of some of the graphs to make connections between COVID restrictions and traffic stops more clear. Additional tweaks to the project could include coding data sets by color to indicate gender and/or ethnicity of the drivers stopped. The number of stops could also be correlated with overall COVID case numbers in Vermont, which could also be time-logged with the additions and removals of restrictions.
