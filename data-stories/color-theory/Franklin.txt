ÊIn Armorik, that called is Britayne,
Ther was aÊknyghtÊthat loved and dide his payne
To serve a lady in his beste wise;
And many a labour, many a greetÊemprise,
He for his lady wroghte,ÊerÊshe were wonne.
For she wasÊoonÊthe faireste underÊsonne,
AndÊeekÊtherto comen of so heighÊkynrede
That welÊunnethesÊdorsteÊthis knyght forÊdrede
Telle hir hisÊwo, his peyne, and his distresse.
But atte laste, she for hisÊworthynesse,
And namely for his mekeÊobeysaunce,
Hath swiche a pitee caught of hisÊpenaunce,
ThatÊpryvelyÊshe fil of hisÊaccord
To take hym for hirÊhousbondeÊand hir lord,
OfÊswichÊlordshipe as menÊhanÊover hir wyves-
And for to lede the moore in blisse hir lyves,
Of his free wyl he swoor hir as a knyght,
That nevere in al hisÊlyfÊhe, day ne nyght,
Ne sholde upon hym take no maistrie
Agayn hir wyl, neÊkitheÊhir jalousie,
But hir obeye and folwe hir wyl in al
As any lovere to his lady shal,
SaveÊthat the name of soveraynetee,
That wolde he have, for shame of his degree.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊShe thanked hym, and with ful greet humblesse

She seyde, "Sire,ÊsithÊof youreÊgentillesse

Ye profre me to have so large a reyne,

Ne wolde nevere GodÊbitwixeÊus tweyne,

As in my gilt, were outherÊwerreÊor stryf.
50
Sir, I wol be youre humbleÊtreweÊwyf,

Have heer myÊtroutheÊtil that mynÊherteÊbreste."

Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊFor o thyng, sires,ÊsauflyÊdar I seye,

That freendesÊeverychÊootherÊmootÊobeye,
55
If they wol longe holden compaignye.

Love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye;

Whan maistrie comth, the God of LoveÊanon

Beteth hise wynges, and farewel, he is gon!

Love is a thyng as any spirit free.
60
Wommen, of kynde desiren libertee,

And nat to been constreyned as aÊthral;

And so doon men, if IÊsoothÊseyen shal.

Looke who that is moost pacient in love,

He is at his avantage al above.
65
Pacience is an heigh vertu, certeyn,

For it venquysseth, as thise clerkes seyn,

Thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne.

For every word men may nat chide or pleyne,

Lerneth to suffre, or elles, soÊmootÊI goon,
70
Ye shul it lerne, wherso ye wole or noon.

For in this world, certein, ther noÊwightÊis

That he neÊdoothÊor seith som tyme amys.

Ire, siknesse, or constellacioun

Wyn,Êwo, or chaungynge ofÊcomplexioun
75
CausethÊful ofteÊto doon amys or speken.

On every wrong a man may nat be wreken;

After the tyme moste be temperaunce

To everyÊwightÊthat kan onÊgovernaunce.

And therfore hath this wiseÊworthyÊknyght,
80
To lyve inÊese,ÊsuffranceÊhirÊbihight,

And she to hymÊfulÊwisly gan to swere

That nevere sholde ther beÊdefauteÊin here.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHeere may men seen an humble wys accord!

Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord,
85
Servant in love, and lord in mariage;

Thanne was he bothe in lordship and servage-

Servage? Nay, but in lordshipeÊabove,

SithÊhe hath bothe his lady and his love-

His lady,Êcertes, and hisÊwyfÊalso,
90
The which that lawe of love acordeth to.

And whan he was in this prosperitee,

HoomÊwith hisÊwyfÊheÊgoothÊto hisÊcontree,

Nat fer fro Pedmark, ther his dwellyng was,

Where as he lyveth in blisse and in solas.
95
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊWhoÊkoudeÊtelle, but he haddeÊweddedÊbe,

The joye, theÊese, and the prosperitee

That isÊbitwixeÊan housbonde and hisÊwyf?

A yeer and moore lasted thisÊblisfulÊlyf,

Til that the knyght of which I speke of thus,
100
That of Kayrrud wasÊclepedÊArveragus,

Shoop hym to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweyne,

In Engelond, thatÊclepedÊwasÊeekÊBriteyne,

To seke in armesÊworshipeÊand honour-

For al his lust he sette inÊswichÊlabour-
105
And dwelled there two yeer, the book seith thus.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊNow wol I stynten of this Arveragus,

And speken I wole of Dorigene hisÊwyf,

That loveth hirÊhousbondeÊas hir hertesÊlyf.

For his absence wepeth she and siketh,
110
As doon thise noble wyves whanÊhemÊliketh.

She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth,

Desir of his presence hir soÊdestreyneth,

That al this wyde world she sette at noght,

Hir freendes whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,
115
Conforten hir in al that ever they may.

They prechen hir, they telle hir nyght and day

That causelees she sleeth hirself, allas!

And every confort possible in this cas

They doon to hir, with all hir bisynesse,
120
Al for to make hir leve hir hevynesse.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊBy proces, as ye knowen everichoon,

Men may so longe graven in a stoon,

Til som figure therinneÊemprentedÊbe.

So longeÊhanÊthey conforted hir, til she
125
Receyved hath by hope and byÊresoun

TheÊemprentyngÊof hir consolacioun,

ThurghÊwhich hir greteÊsorweÊgan aswage;

She may nat alweyÊdurenÊinÊswichÊrage.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAndÊeekÊArveragus, in al this care,
130
Hath sent hir lettresÊhoomÊof his welfare,

And that he wol com hastily agayn,

Or elles hadde thisÊsorweÊhirÊherteÊslayn.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHir freendes sawe hirÊsorweÊgan to slake,

And preyde hir on knees, for Goddes sake,
135
To com and romen hir in compaignye,

Awey to dryve hirÊderkeÊfantasye.

And finally she graunted that requeste,

For wel sheÊsaughÊthat it was for the beste.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊNow stood hir castel faste by theÊsee;
140
And often with hir freendes walketh she

Hire toÊdisporte, upon the bank an heigh,

Where as she many a ship andÊbargeÊseigh

Seillynge hir cours, where asÊhemÊlisteÊgo.

But thanne was that aÊparcelÊof hirÊwo,
145
For to hirselfÊful ofteÊ"Allas," seith she,

"Is ther no ship of so many as I se

Wol bryngenÊhoomÊmy lord? Thanne were mynÊherte

Al warisshed of hisse bittre peynes smerte."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAnother tyme ther wolde she sitte and thynke
150
And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke;

But whan sheÊsaughÊthe reislyÊrokkesÊblake,

ForÊverrayÊfeere, so wolde hirÊherteÊquake

That on hire feet she myghte hir noght sustene.

Thanne wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,
155
And pitously into theÊseeÊbiholde,

And seyn right thus, with sorweful sikes colde:


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"EterneÊGod, thatÊthurghÊthyÊpurveiaunce

Ledest the world by certeinÊgovernaunce,

In ydel, as men seyn, ye no thyng make.
160
But, lord, thise grisly feendlyÊrokkesÊblake,

That semen rather a foul confusioun

Of werk, than any fair creacioun

OfÊswichÊaÊparfitÊwys God and a stable,

WhyÊhanÊye wroght this werk unresonable?
165
For by this werk, south, north, ne west ne eest

Ther nysÊyfostredÊman, ne bryd, ne beest.

ItÊdoothÊno good, to myÊwit, but anoyeth,

Se ye nat, lord, how mankynde it destroyeth?

An hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde
170
HanÊrokkesÊslayn, al be they nat in mynde;

Which mankynde is so fair part of thy werk

That thou it madest lyk to thyn oweneÊmerk.

Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee

Toward mankynde; but how thanne may it bee
175
That ye swiche meenes make it to destroyen,

Whiche meenes do no good, but evere anoyen?

IÊwootÊwel clerkes wol seyn, asÊhemÊleste,

ByÊargumentz, that al is for the beste,

Though I ne kan the causes nat yknowe,
180
ButÊthilkeÊGod that made wynd to blowe

AsÊkepeÊmy lord; this my conclusioun.

To clerkes lete I al this disputisoun-

But wolde God, that alle thiseÊrokkesÊblake,

WereÊsonkenÊinto helle for his sake!
185
ThiseÊrokkesÊsleenÊmynÊherteÊfor the feere!"

Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous teere.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHir freendes sawe that it was noÊdisport

To romen by theÊsee, but disconfort,

And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles;
190
They leden hir by ryveres and by welles,

AndÊeekÊin othere places delitables;

They dauncen, and they pleyen atÊchesÊandÊtables.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊSo on a day, right in the morwe tyde,

Unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde,
195
In which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunce

OfÊvitailleÊand ofÊootherÊpurveiaunce,

They goon and pleyeÊhemÊal the longe day.

And this was in the sixte morwe of May,

Which May hadde peynted with his softe shoures
200
This gardyn ful of leves and of floures,

And craft of mannes hand soÊcuriously

ArrayedÊhadde this gardynÊtrewely,

That nevere was ther gardyn ofÊswichÊprys,

But if it were theÊverrayÊParadys.
205
The odour of floures and the fresshe sighte

WoldeÊhanÊmaked anyÊherteÊlighte

That evere was born, but if to greet siknesse

Or to greet sorwe helde it in distresse;

So ful it was ofÊbeauteeÊwithÊplesaunce.
210
At after-dyner gonne they to daunce

And synge also,ÊsaveÊDorigen allone,

Which made alwey hir compleint and hir moone

For she neÊsaughÊhym on the daunce go

That was hirÊhousbonde, and hir love also.
215
ButÊnatheleesÊshe moste a tymeÊabyde,

And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊUpon this daunce, amonges othere men,

Daunced aÊsquierÊbiforn Dorigen

That fressher was, and jolyer ofÊarray,
220
As to my doom, than is the monthe of May.

He syngeth, daunceth, passynge any man

That is or was,ÊsithÊthat the world bigan.

Therwith he was, if men sholde hym discryve,

OonÊof the beste farynge man of lyve;
225
Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche, and wys,

And wel biloved, and holden in greet prys.

And shortly, if theÊsotheÊI tellen shal,

Unwityng of this Dorigen at al,

ThisÊlustyÊsquier, servant to Venus,
230
Which thatÊyclepedÊwas Aurelius,

Hadde loved hir best of any creature

Two yeer and moore, as was his aventure;

But nevere dorste he tellen hir his grevaunce,

Withouten coppe he drank al hisÊpenaunce.
235
He was despeyred, no thyng dorste he seye

SaveÊin his songes somwhat wolde heÊwreye

HisÊwo, as in a general compleynyng.

He seyde he lovede, and was biloved no thyng,

OfÊswichÊmatere made he manye layes,
240
Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,

How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,

But langwissheth, as a furyeÊdoothÊin helle,

And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide Ekko

For Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hirÊwo,
245
InÊootherÊmanere than ye heere me seye,

Ne dorste he nat to hir hisÊwoÊbiwreye,

SaveÊthatÊparaventureÊsom tyme at daunces,

Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,

It may wel be he looked on hir face,
250
InÊswichÊa wise as man that asketh grace;

But nothyng wiste she of hisÊentente.

NatheleesÊit happed,ÊerÊthey thennes wente,

By cause that he was hir neighebour,

And was a man ofÊworshipeÊand honour,
255
And hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore,

They fille in speche, and forthe moore and moore

Unto this purpos drough Aurelius.

And whan heÊsaughÊhis tyme, he seyde thus:


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Madame,"ÊquodÊhe, "by God that this world made,
260
So that IÊwisteÊit myghte yourÊherteÊglade,

I wolde that day that youre Arveragus

Wente over the see, that I, Aurelius,

Hadde went ther nevere I sholde have come agayn.

For wel IÊwootÊmy servyce is in vayn,
265
MyÊgerdounÊis but brestyng of mynÊherte.

Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte,

For with a word ye may meÊsleenÊor save.

Heere at your feet, God wolde that I were grave,

I ne have as now no leyser moore to seye,
270
Have mercy, sweete, or ye wol do me deye."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊShe gan to looke upon Aurelius:

"Is this youre wyl!"ÊquodÊshe, "and sey ye thus?

NevereÊerst,"ÊquodÊshe, "neÊwisteÊI what ye mente.

But now, Aurelie, I knowe youreÊentente.
275
ByÊthilkeÊGod, thatÊyafÊme soule andÊlyf,

Ne shal I nevere beenÊuntreweÊwyf,

In word ne werk, as fer as I haveÊwit.

I wol been his to whom that I am knyt.

Taak this for fynal answere as of me."
280
But after that, in pley thus seyde she,


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Aurelie,"ÊquodÊshe, "by heighe God above,

Yet wolde I graunte yow to been youre love,

SynÊI yow se so pitouslyÊcomplayne.

Looke, what day that endelong Britayne
285
Ye remoeve alle theÊrokkes, stoon by stoon,

That they ne lette shipe ne boot to goon, -

I seye, whan yeÊhanÊmaad the coost so clene

OfÊrokkesÊthat ther nys no stoon ysene,

Thanne wol I love yow best of any man,
290
Have heer myÊtroutheÊin al that evere I kan."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Is ther noonÊootherÊgrace in yow?"ÊquodÊhe.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"No, by that lord,"ÊquodÊshe, "that maked me;

For wel IÊwootÊthat it shal nevere bityde;

Lat swiche folies out of yourÊherteÊslyde.
295
WhatÊdeynteeÊsholde a manÊhanÊin hisÊlyf

For to go love another mannesÊwyf,

That hath hir body whan so that hym liketh?"

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAureliusÊful ofteÊsooreÊsiketh,

WoÊwas Aurelie, whan that he thisÊherde,
300
And with a sorwefulÊherteÊhe thus answered.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Madame,"ÊquodÊhe, "this were anÊinpossible;

ThanneÊmootÊI dye of sodeyn deth horrible."

And with that word he turned hymÊanon.

Tho coome hir othere freendes manyÊoon,
305
And in theÊaleyesÊromeden up and doun,

And nothyng wiste of this conclusioun,

ButÊsodeynlyÊbigonne revel newe,

Til that the brighteÊsonneÊloste hisÊhewe,

ForÊth'orisonteÊhath reft the sonne his lyght -
310
This is as muche to seye as it was nyght -

AndÊhoomÊthey goon in joye and in solas,

SaveÊoonly wrecche Aurelius, allas!

He to his hous is goon with sorwefulÊherte;

He seeth he may nat fro hisÊdeethÊasterte;
315
Hym semed that he felte hisÊherteÊcolde;

Up to theÊheveneÊhise handes he gan holde,

And on hiseÊknowesÊbare he sette hym doun,

And in his ravyng seyde his orisoun.

ForÊverrayÊwoÊout of hisÊwitÊhe breyde;
320
He nyste what he spak, but thus he seyde:

With pitousÊherteÊhis pleynt hath he bigonne

Unto the goddes, and first unto theÊsonne


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHe seyde, "Appollo, god and governour

Of every plaunte, herbe, tree, and flour
325
That yevest after thy declinacioun

ToÊechÊofÊhemÊhis tyme and his sesoun,

As thynÊherberweÊchaungeth lowe or heighe,

LordÊPhebus, cast thy mericiable eighe

On wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn.
330
Lo, lord, my lady hath my deeth ysworn

Withoute gilt, but thyÊbenignytee

Upon my dedlyÊherteÊhave som pitee.

For wel IÊwoot, lord Phebus, if yowÊlest,

Ye may me helpen, save my lady, best.
335
Now voucheth sauf that I may yowÊdevyse

How that I may been holpen and in what wyse.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"YourÊblisfulÊsuster, Lucina the sheene,

That of the see is chief goddesse and queene,

(Though Neptunus have deitee in the see,
340
Yet emperisse aboven hym is she),

Ye knowen wel, lord, that right as hir desir

Is to be quyked and lightned of youreÊfir,

For which she folweth yow ful bisily,

Right so the see desireth naturelly
345
To folwen hir, as she that is goddesse

Bothe in the see and ryveres moore and lesse.

Wherfore, lord Phebus, this is my requeste -

Do this miracle, or do mynÊherteÊbreste, -

That now next at this opposicioun
350
Which in the signe shal be of the Leoun,

As preieth hir, so greet a flood to brynge

That fyveÊfadmeÊat the leeste it oversprynge

The hyeste rokke in Armorik Briteyne,

And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne.
355
Thanne,Êcertes, to my lady may I seye

'Holdeth youre heste, theÊrokkesÊbeen aweye.'

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊLord Phebus,ÊdoothÊthis miracle for me,

Preye hir she go no faster cours than ye.

I seye, preyeth your suster that she go
360
No faster cours than ye thise yeres two.

Thanne shal she been evene atte fulle alway;

And spryng flood laste bothe nyght and day;

And but sheÊvouche saufÊinÊswichÊmanere

To graunte me myÊsovereynÊlady deere,
365
Prey hir to synken every rok adoun

Into hir owene dirke regioun

Under the ground ther Pluto dwelleth inne,

Or nevere mo shal I my lady wynne.

Thy temple in Delphos wol I barefoot seke,
370
Lord Phebus; se theÊteerisÊon my cheke,

And of my peyne have som compassioun!"

And with that word in swowne he fil adoun,

And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHis brother, which that knew of hisÊpenaunce,
375
Up caughte hym, and to bedde he hath hym broght.

Dispeyred in this torment and this thoght

Lete I this woful creature lye;

CheseÊhe for me wheither he wol lyve or dye.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊArveragus, with heele and greet honour,
380
As he that was ofÊchivalrieÊthe flour,

Is comenÊhoom, and othereÊworthyÊmen.

OÊblisfulÊartow now, thou Dorigen!

That hast thy lustyÊhousbondeÊin thyne armes,

The fresshe knyght, theÊworthyÊman or armes,
385
That loveth thee, as his owene hertesÊlyf.

No thyng list hym to been ymaginatyf

If anyÊwightÊhadde spoke, whil he was oute,

To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute,

He noght entendeth to noÊswichÊmateere,
390
But daunceth, justeth, maketh hir good cheere,

And thus in joye and blisse I leteÊhemÊdwelle,

And of the sike Aurelius I wol telle.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊIn langour and in torment furyes

Two yeer and moore lay wrecche Aurelyus,
395
ErÊany foot he myghte onÊertheÊgon;

Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,

SaveÊof his brother, which that was aÊclerk.

He knew of al thisÊwoÊand al this werk;

For to noonÊootherÊcreature, certeyn,
400
Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.

Under his brest he baar it moore secree

Than evere dide Pamphilus for Galathee.

His brest was hool withoute for to sene,

But in hisÊherteÊayÊwas the arwe kene.
405
And wel ye knowe that of a sursanure

In surgerye is perilous the cure,

But men myghte touche the arwe, or come therby.

His brother weep and wayled pryvely,

Til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce
410
That whiles he was at Orliens in Fraunce,

As yonge clerkes, that been lykerous

To reden artes that been curious,

Seken in every halke and every herne

Particular sciences for to lerne, -
415
He hym remembred, that upon a day

At Orliens in studie a book he say

OfÊmagyk natureel, which his felawe,

That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe-

Al were he ther to lerne another craft,
420
HaddeÊprivelyÊupon his desk ylaft;

Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns,

Touchynge the eighte and twenty mansiouns

That longen to the moone, andÊswichÊfolye

As in oure dayes is nat worth a flye, -
425
For hooly chirches feith in oure bileve

Ne suffreth noon illusioun us to greve.

And whan this book was in his remembraunce,

AnonÊfor joye hisÊherteÊgan to daunce,

And to hymself he seydeÊpryvely,
430
"My brother shal be warisshed hastily;

For I am siker that ther be sciences

By whiche men make diverse apparences

Swiche as thise subtileÊtregetouresÊpleye;

For ofte at feestes have I wel herd seye
435
ThatÊtregetouresÊwithinne an halle large

Have maad come in a water and aÊbarge,

And in the halle rowenÊup and doun.

Somtyme hath semed come a grymÊleoun;

And somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede,
440
Somtyme a vyne, and grapes white andÊrede,

Somtyme a castel al of lym and stoon;

And whanÊhemÊlyked, voyded itÊanoon,

Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊNow thanne conclude I thus, that if I myghte
445
At Orliens som oold felawe yfynde

That hadde this moones mansions in mynde,

OrÊootherÊmagyk natureelÊabove,

He sholde wel make my brotherÊhanÊhis love;

For with an apparence a clerk may make
450
To mannes sighte, that alle theÊrokkesÊblake

Of Britaigne werenÊyvoydedÊeverichon,

And shippes by the brynke comen and gon,

And inÊswichÊforme enduren a wowke or two.

Thanne were my brother warisshed of hisÊwo;
455
Thanne moste she nedes holden hireÊbiheste,

Or elles he shal shame hire atte leste."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊWhat sholde I make a lenger tale of this?

Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,

AndÊswichÊconfort heÊyafÊhym for to gon
460
To Orliens that he up stirteÊanon,

And on his wey forthward thanne is he fare

In hope for to been lissed of his care.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊWhan they were come almoost to that citee,

But if it were a furlong or three,
465
A yongÊclerkÊromynge by hymself they mette,

Which that in LatynÊthriftilyÊhemÊgrette,

And after that he seyde a wonder thyng:

"I knowe,"ÊquodÊhe, "the cause of youre comyng."

AndÊerÊthey ferther any foote wente,
470
He toldeÊhemÊal that was in hireÊentente.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThis BritonÊclerkÊhym asked of felawes

The whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes,

And he answerde hym that they dede were,

For which he weepÊful ofteÊmany a teere.
475
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊDoun of his hors Aurelius lighteÊanon,

And with this magicien forth is he gon

HoomÊto his hous, and madenÊhemÊwel at ese.

HemÊlakked noÊvitailleÊthat myghteÊhemÊplese.

So welÊarrayedÊhous as ther wasÊoon
480
Aurelius in hisÊlyfÊsaughÊnevere noon.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHe shewed hym,ÊerÊhe wente to sopeer,

Forestes, parkes ful of wilde deer;

TherÊsaughÊhe hertes with hir hornes hye,

The gretteste that evere were seyn with ye.
485
HeÊsaughÊofÊhemÊan hondred slayn with houndes,

And somme withÊarwesÊblede of bittre woundes.

HeÊsaugh, whanÊvoydedÊwere thise wilde deer,

Thise fauconers upon a fair ryver,

That with hir haukesÊhanÊthe heron slayn.
490
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThoÊsaughÊhe knyghtes justyng in a playn;

And after this he dide hymÊswichÊplesaunce

That he hym shewed his lady on a daunce,

On which hymself he daunced, as hym thoughte.

And whan this maister that his magyk wroughte
495
SaughÊit was tyme, he clapte his handes two,

And farewel! al oure revel was ago.

And yet remoeved they nevere out of the hous,

Whil theyÊsaughÊal thisÊsighteÊmarveillous,

But in his studie, ther as his bookes be,
500
They seten stille, and noÊwightÊbut theyÊthre.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊTo hym this maister called hisÊsquier,

And seyde hym thus: "Is redy oure soper?

Almoost an houre it is, IÊundertake,

SithÊI yow bad oure soper for to make,
505
Whan that thiseÊworthyÊmen wenten with me

Into my studie, ther as my bookes be."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Sire,"ÊquodÊthisÊsquier, "whan it liketh yow,

It is al redy, though ye wol right now."

"Go we thanne soupe,"ÊquodÊhe, "as for the beste.
510
Thise amorousÊfolkÊsomtyme mooteÊhanÊhir reste."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAt after-soper fille they in tretee

What somme sholde this maistresÊgerdonÊbe,

To remoeven alle theÊrokkesÊof Britayne,

AndÊeekÊfrom Gerounde to the mouth of Sayne

515
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHe made it straunge, and swoor, so God hym save,

Lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat have,

Ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAurelius, with blisfulÊherteÊanoon,

Answerde thus: "Fy on a thousand pound!
520
This wyde world, which that men seye is round,

I wolde itÊyeve, if I were lord of it.

This bargayn is ful dryve, for we been knyt.

Ye shal be payedÊtrewely, by myÊthrouthe!

But looketh now for no necligence orÊslouthe
525
Ye tarie us heere, no lenger than to-morwe."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Nay,"ÊquodÊthis clerk, "have heer my feith to borwe.'

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊTo bedde is goon Aurelius whan hymÊleste,

And wel ny al that nyght he hadde his reste;

What for his labour and his hope of blisse,
530
His wofulÊherteÊofÊpenaunceÊhadde a lisse.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊUpon the morwe, whan that it was day,

To Britaigne tooke they the righte way,

Aurelius and this magicien bisyde,

And been descended ther they woldeÊabyde.
535
And this was, as thise bookes me remembre,

The colde, frosty sesoun of Decembre.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊPhebus wax old, and hewed lykÊlatoun,

That in this hoote declynacioun

Shoon as the burned gold, and stremes brighte;
540
But now in Capricorn adoun he lighte,

Where as he shoon ful pale, I dar wel seyn.

The bittre frostes, with the sleet and reyn,

Destroyed hath the grene in everyÊyerd;

Janus sit by theÊfyr, with double berd,
545
And drynketh of his bugle horn the wyn.

Biforn hym stantÊbrawenÊof the tusked swyn,

And "Nowel" crieth everyÊlustyÊman.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAurelius, in al that evere he kan,

DoothÊto his master chiere andÊreverence,
550
And preyeth hym to doon hisÊdiligence

To bryngen hym out of his peynes smerte,

Or with aÊswerdÊthat he wolde slitte hisÊherte.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThis subtil clerkÊswichÊroutheÊhad of this man,

That nyght and day he spedde hym that he kan
555
To wayten a tyme of his conclusioun,

This is to seye, to maken illusioun

ByÊswichÊan apparence or jogelrye -

I ne kan no termes of astrologye -

That she and everyÊwightÊsholde wene and seye
560
That of Britaigne theÊrokkesÊwere aweye,

Or ellis they wereÊsonkenÊunder grounde.

So atte laste he hath his tyme yfounde

To maken hiseÊjapesÊand his wrecchednesse

OfÊswichÊa supersticious cursednesse.
565
Hise tables Tolletanes forth he brought,

Ful welÊcorrected, ne ther lakked nought,

Neither his collect ne hise expans yeeris,

Ne his rootes, ne hise othere geeris,

As been his centris and hise argumentz,
570
And hise proporcioneles convenientz

For hise equacions in every thyng.

And by his eighte speere in his wirkyng

He knew ful wel how fer Alnath was shove

Fro theÊheedÊofÊthilkeÊfixe Aries above
575
That in the ninthe speere considered is.

Ful subtilly he kalkuled al this.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊWhan he hadde founde his firsteÊmansioun,

He knew the remenaunt by proporcioun,

And knew the arisyng of his moone weel,
580
And in whos face and terme, andÊeverydeel;

And knew ful weel the moones mansioun

Acordaunt to his operacioun,

And knew also hise othere observaunces

For swiche illusiouns and swiche meschaunces
585
As hethen folk useden inÊthilkeÊdayes;-

For which no lenger maked he delayes,

ButÊthurghÊhis magik, for aÊwykeÊorÊtweye,

It semed that alle theÊrokkesÊwere aweye.


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAurelius, which that yet despeired is,
590
Wher he shalÊhanÊhis love, or fare amys,

Awaiteth nyght and day on this myracle.

And whan he knew that ther was noon obstacle,

ThatÊvoydedÊwere thiseÊrokkesÊeverychon,

Doun to hise maistres feet he filÊanon,
595
And seyde, "I woful wrecche, Aurelius,

Thanke yow, lord, and lady myn, Venus,

That meÊhanÊholpen fro my cares colde."

And to the temple his wey forth hath he holde

Where as he knew he sholde his lady see,
600
And whan heÊsaughÊhis tyme,ÊanonÊright hee

With dredfulÊherteÊand withÊfulÊhumbleÊcheere

Salewed hath hisÊsovereynÊlady deere.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"My righte lady,"ÊquodÊthis woful man,

"Whom IÊmoostÊdredeÊand love as I best kan,
605
And lothest were of al this world displese,

Nere it that I for yow haveÊswichÊdisese

For madame, wel yeÊwootÊwhat yeÊhanÊhight -

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHe taketh his leve, and she astonied stood,

In al hir face nas a drope of blood.

She wende nevereÊhanÊcome inÊswichÊa trappe.

"Allas,"ÊquodÊshe, "that evere this sholde happe.
635
For wende I nevere, by possibilitee,

ThatÊswichÊa monstre or merveille myghte be.

It is agayns the proces of nature."

AndÊhoomÊshe goth a sorweful creature,

ForÊverrayÊfeereÊunnetheÊmay she go.
640
She wepeth, wailleth, al a day or two,

And swowneth that itÊroutheÊwas to see;

But why it was, to noÊwightÊtolde shee,

For out of towne was goon Arveragus.

But to hirself she spak, and seyde thus,
645
With face pale and with ful sorweful cheere,

In hire compleynt, as ye shal after heere.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Allas!"ÊquodÊshe, "on thee, Fortune, I pleyne,

655
And with my deth I may be quyt, ywis;

Hath ther nat many a nobleÊwyfÊerÊthis

And many aÊmaydeÊyslayn hirself, allas,

Rather than with hir body doon trespas?


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊYis,Êcertes, lo, thise stories beren witnesse,
660
Whan thritty tirauntz, ful of cursednesse,

Hadde slayn Phidoun in Atthenes, at feste,

They comanded hise doghtres for tareste,

And bryngenÊhemÊbifornÊhemÊinÊdespit,

Al naked, to fulfille hir foulÊdelit,
665
And in hir fadres blood they madeÊhemÊdaunce

Upon the pavement, GodÊyeveÊhemÊmeschaunce!

For which thise woful maydens ful ofÊdrede,

Rather than they wolde lese hirÊmaydenhede,

TheyÊprivelyÊbeen stirt into aÊwelle
670
AndÊdreynteÊhemselven, as the bookes telle.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThey of Mecene leete enquere and seke

Of Lacedomye fifty maydensÊeke,

On whiche they wolden doon hirÊlecherye;

But was ther noon of al that compaignye
675
That she nas slayn, and with a goodÊentente

CheesÊrather for to dye thanÊassente

To been oppressed of hirÊmaydenhede.

Why sholde I thanne to dye been inÊdrede?

Lo, eek, the tiraunt Aristoclides,
680
That loved a mayden heet Stymphalides,

Whan that hirÊfaderÊslayn was on a nyght,

Unto Dianes temple goth she right,

And hente the ymage in hir handes two;

Fro which ymage wolde she nevere go,
685
No wight ne myghte hir handes of it arace,

Til she was slayn right in the selve place.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊNowÊsithÊthat maydens haddenÊswichÊdespit,

To been defouled with mannes foulÊdelit,

Wel oghte aÊwyfÊrather hirselvenÊslee,
690
Than be defouled, as it thynketh me.

What shal I seyn of HasdrubalesÊwyf

That at CartageÊbirafteÊhirself hirÊlyf?

For whan sheÊsaughÊthat Romayns wan the toun,

She took hir children alle and skipte adoun
695
Into theÊfyr, andÊcheesÊrather to dye

Than any Romayn dide hirÊvileynye.

Hath nat Lucresse yslayn hirself, allas!

At Rome whan that she oppressed was

Of Tarquyn, for hir thoughte it was a shame
700
To lyven whan she hadde lost hir name?

The sevene maydens of Milesie also

HanÊslayn hemself, forÊverrayÊdredeÊandÊwo

Rather than folk of GawleÊhemÊsholde oppresse.

Mo than a thousand stories, as IÊgesse,
705
Koude I now telle as touchynge this mateere.

Whan Habradate was slayn, hisÊwyfÊso deere

Hirselven slow, and leet hir blood to glyde

In Habradates woundes depe and wyde;

And seyde, 'My body at the leeste way
710
Ther shal no wight defoulen, if I may.'


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊWhat sholde I moÊensamplesÊheer of sayn?

SithÊthat so manyeÊhanÊhemselven slayn,

Wel rather than they wolde defouled be,

I wol conclude that it is bet for me
715
ToÊsleenÊmyself, than been defouled thus.

I wol beÊtreweÊunto Arveragus,

Or ratherÊsleenÊmyself in som manere,

As dide Demociones doghter deere,

By cause that she wolde nat defouled be.
720
O Cedasus, it is ful greet pitee

To reden how thy doghtren deyde, allas,

That slowe hemself, forÊswichÊmanere cas!

As greet a pitee was it, or wel moore,

The Theban mayden, that for Nichanore
725
Hirselven slow right forÊswichÊmanereÊwo.

Another Theban mayden dide right so;

ForÊoonÊof Macidonye hadde hire oppressed,

What shal I seye of NiceratesÊwyf,
730
That forÊswichÊcasÊbirafteÊhirself hirÊlyf?

HowÊtreweÊeekÊwas to Alcebiades

Lo, which aÊwyfÊwas Alceste,"ÊquodÊshe,
735
"What seith Omer of goode Penalopee?

Al Grece knoweth of hire chastitee.

PardeeÊof Lacedomya is writen thus,

That whan at Troie was slayn Protheselaus,

Ne lenger wolde she lyve after his day.
740
The same of noble Porcia telle I may,

Withoute Brutus koude she nat lyve,

To whom she hadde al hool hirÊherteÊyeve.

O Teuta, queene! thy wyfly chastitee

Of Rodogone, andÊeekÊValeria."

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThus pleyned Dorigene a day or tweye,
750
Purposynge evere that she wolde deye.

ButÊnathelees, upon the thridde nyght

HoomÊcam Arveragus, thisÊworthyÊknyght,

And asked hir why that she weep so soore.

And she gan wepen ever lenger the moore.
755
"Allas!"ÊquodÊshe, "that evere I was born.

Thus have I seyd,"ÊquodÊshe, "thus have I sworn" -

And toold hym al as yeÊhanÊherd bifore,

It nedeth natÊreherceÊit yow namoore.

ThisÊhousbondeÊwith glad chiere in freendly wyse
760
Answerde and seyde, as I shal yowÊdevyse,

"Is ther oght elles, Dorigen, but this?"


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Nay, nay,"ÊquodÊshe, "God helpe me so, as wys,

This is to muche, and it were Goddes wille."

"Ye,Êwyf,"ÊquodÊhe, "lat slepen that is stille.
765
It may be welÊparaventureÊyet to-day.

Ye shul youreÊtroutheÊholden, by my fay.

For God so wisly have mercy upon me,

770
But if ye sholde yourÊtroutheÊkepe and save.

TroutheÊis the hyeste thyng that man may kepe."

But with that word he brastÊanonÊto wepe

And seyde, "I yow forbede, up peyne ofÊdeeth,

That nevere whil thee lastethÊlyfÊne breeth,
775
To noÊwightÊtelle thou of this aventure -

As I may best, I wol myÊwoÊendure, -

Ne make no contenance ofÊhevynesse,

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAnd forth heÊclepedÊaÊsquierÊand aÊmayde;
780
"GoothÊforthÊanonÊwith Dorigen," he sayde,

"And bryngeth hir toÊswichÊa placeÊanon,"

They take hir leve, and on hir wey they gon,

But they ne weste why she thider wente,

He nolde noÊwightÊtellen hisÊentente.
785
ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊParaventure, an heep of yow, ywis,

Wol holden hym aÊlewedÊman in this,

That he wol putte hisÊwyfÊin jupartie.

HerknethÊthe taleÊerÊye upon hire crie;

She may have bettre fortune than yow semeth,
790
And whan that yeÊhanÊherd the tale, demeth.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThisÊsquier, which thatÊhighteÊAurelius,

On Dorigen that was so amorus,

Of aventure happed hir to meete

Amydde theÊtoun, right in theÊquykkest strete,
795
As she was bown to goon the wey forth-right

Toward the gardyn, ther as she had hight.

And he was to the gardyn-ward also,

For wel he spyed whan she wolde go

Out of hir hous to any maner place.
800
But thus they mette, of aventure or grace

And heÊsalewethÊhir with gladÊentente,

And asked of hir whiderward she wente.

And she answerde, half as she were mad,

"Unto the gardyn as mynÊhousbondeÊbad,
805
MyÊtroutheÊfor to holde, allas! allas!"


ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAurelius gan wondren on this cas,

And in hisÊherteÊhadde greet compassioun

Of hir and of hir lamentacioun,

And of Arveragus, theÊworthyÊknyght,
810
That bad hire holden al that she had hight,

So looth hym was hisÊwyfÊsholde breke hirÊtrouthe;

And in hisÊherteÊhe caughte of this greetÊrouthe,

Considerynge the beste on every syde

That fro his lust yet were hymÊlevereÊabyde
815
Than doon so heigh a cherlyssh wrecchednesse

Agayns franchise and alleÊgentillesse.-

For which in fewe wordes seyde he thus:

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Madame, seyeth to your lord Arveragus,

ThatÊsithÊI se his greteÊgentillesse
820
To yow, andÊeekÊI se wel youre distresse,

That him wereÊlevereÊhanÊshame - and that wereÊroutheÊ-

Than ye to me sholde breke thus youreÊtrouthe,

I have welÊlevereÊevere to suffreÊwo

Than I departe the loveÊbitwixÊyow two.
825
I yow relesse, madame, into youre hond

Quyt every surement and every bond,

That yeÊhanÊmaad to me as heer biforn,

SithÊthilkeÊtyme which that ye were born.

MyÊtroutheÊIÊplighte, I shal yow never repreve

Of noÊbiheste, and heere I take my leve,

As of the treweste and the besteÊwyf

But everyÊwyfÊbeÊwarÊof hirÊbiheeste,

On Dorigen remembreth atte leeste!
835
Thus kan aÊsquierÊdoon aÊgentilÊdede

As wel as kan a knyght, with outenÊdrede.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊShe thonketh hym upon hir knees al bare,

AndÊhoomÊunto hirÊhousbondeÊis she fare,

And tolde hym al, as yeÊhanÊherd me sayd;
840
And be yeÊsiker, he was soÊweelÊapayd

That it were inpossible me to wryte.

What sholde I lenger of this casÊendyte?

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊArveragus and Dorigen hisÊwyf

In sovereyn blisse leden forth hirÊlyf,
845
NevereÊeftÊne was ther angreÊhemÊbitwene.

He cherisseth hire as though she were a queene,

And she was to hymÊtreweÊfor everemoore.-

Of thise twoÊfolkÊye gete of me namoore.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊAurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn
850
Curseth the tyme that evere he was born.

"Allas,"ÊquodÊhe, "allas, that IÊbihighte

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Yes,Êcertes, wel andÊtrewely,"ÊquodÊhe.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"Hastow nat had thy lady, as thee liketh?"

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"No, no,"ÊquodÊhe, and sorwefully he siketh.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊ"What was the cause, tel me if thou kan?"

885
And tolde hym al, as yeÊhanÊherd bifoore,

It nedeth nat to yowÊreherceÊit moore.

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊHe seide, "Arveragus ofÊgentillesse

ÊÊÊÊÊÊÊThis philosophre answerde, "LeeveÊbrother,
