# Project information

This project is the data story on mental health of youth in the US by BohanMeng. 

# Overview

The main questions of the projects were: 1) what is the current situation of children and young adults' mental health in the US? What are the possible causes if there exists a problem? 

To answer these questions, we collected data that either directly described the mental health of youth in different states, or closely related to the life quality of them, e.g., the safety and security of their community, the unemployment rate of their parents, etc. 

We plotted the data to visualize its trend over time, and calculated the correlation between different factors. 

We found that: 1) the mental health has among the US youth in the past decade; 2) safety, economic, medical resources are likely not the major influence factor of such rising mental health crisis.

We would like to see follow-up studies on the factors that are less easily quantifiable, include pressure from school, peer, and family expectation, information from the internet and social media, uncertainty about future, etc.
