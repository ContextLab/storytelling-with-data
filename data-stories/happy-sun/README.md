# Project information

Alex Wells (alexwells-22) and Karim Khalil (karimkhalil-byte) worked to create Happy Sun.

# Overview

Our project set out to explore the connection between the amount of sunlight that a country gets and its average happiness as reported by the World Happiness Report. We wanted to see if more sunshine in a year has any connection to the happiness of the people who live there. We used public data that exists on Wikipedia and the World Happiness Report and found other sources who adapted the same data to more parseable formats. We used chloropleth maps to show where happiness is highest and most of the year is sunny. We also used a scatterplot with a trendline and independent correlation coefficient to look for a connection between happiness and sunnyness. Importantly, this data can only show a correlation between the measures and not causation.

We did not find the correlation that we anticipated between these measures. It seems that economic stability is correlated much more closely with happiness than the amount of sun that a particular country recieves in a year. Exploring this relationship in a future project could be interesting.

# Downloading the data

Data for number of hours of sunshine per month and year in various cities around the world. Data exists publicly in Wikipedia, data world condensed various tables into one xls file.

# Contributing to the code

The next steps in continuing this project likely include searching for correlations between various economic measures of a country's sucess and that country's happiness. Another strong direction for further exploration is to map where the the most and least sun is each month to create the ideal travel plans for someone who seeks to minimize or maximize their time in the sun. Since that would be on a country level, results could be skewed, especially for parts of Russia, Alaska, or Canada.
