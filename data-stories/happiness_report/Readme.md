# Project information

This project is the data story on factors that influence happiness by Bohan Meng. 

# Overview

The main questions of the projects were: what factors (economic, social, COVID, etc.) influence happiness?

To answer these questions, we collected data from the World Happiness Report before and after COVID and compare the correlations between happiness and different indicators for different time periods. We also collect some other criteria (alcohol consumptions) and calculate their correlations with happiness score.  

We found that: 1) economic, social support, health and freedom factors are strongly positively correlate with happiness, 2) correlation between generosity and happiness is weak, 3) COVID doesn't have a significant effect on people's idea about health but perceptiosn of corruption.

We would like to see follow-up studies on the causal relations between these factors and happiness, especially why generosity is irrelevant (if that's true), and why people attitude to government are so drastically changed by COVID.
