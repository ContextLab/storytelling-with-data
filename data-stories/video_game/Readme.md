# Project information

This project is the data story on the influence of video game playing on people's health and happiness by Bohan Meng. 

# Overview

The main questions of the projects were: what is the effect of video game on players? 

To answer these questions, we collected data on gameplayer's mental states, happiness score and performance at school/work and calculate the correlations between these factors.  

We found that: 1) gameplaying length is mildly negatively correlated students grades and happiness. 2) gameplaying is mildly positively correlated with anxiety and social anxiety, and negatively correlated with life satisfaction. 

We would like to see follow-up studies on addctiveness of video games, which are not included in this analysis. We would also like to see comparisons between video games and other forms of entertainments.
