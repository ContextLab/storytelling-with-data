# Project information

This project is the data story on the influence of sleep deprivation by Bohan Meng. 

# Overview

The main questions of the projects were: how lacking sleep affect people's physical and mental health, as well as their efficiency at work. 

To answer these questions, we collected data that indicate individuals' health conditions, level of stress, and performance in long-term memory tasks. We then analyze and visualize the relations between these indicators and the sleeping time. 

We found that: 1) sleep duration is negatively correlated with participants' level of stress; 2) people with around 6 to 9 hours of sleep have the best health condition, with both short and long sleep correlated with health issues like obesities; 3) disruption of sleep (induced by psychostimulants in the experiment) impair long-term memory. 

We would like to see follow-up studies on more specific correlations between sleeping time and aspects of life quality and hopefully optimization functions. We would also like to explore the causal relations between sleep duration and various factors of physical/mental health and cognitive fucntions.

# Running the code

Starting with the "Data" section, running all the cells in meng_part2_sleep.ipynb will give the visualization and correlation analysis of all data this project includes.
