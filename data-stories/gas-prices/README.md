# Project information

Gas Prices is a data story created by Alex Wells (on github as alexwells-22).

# Overview

With war being fought in Ukraine, gas prices are climbing around the world. In the United States, prices have reached all time highs and are continuing to climb. As I head out on a (poorly timed) road trip, I am not looking forward to paying at the pump. I wondered what domestic factors might influence the prices that Americans in different parts of the country pay since I will pass through many different areas with wildly different gas prices.

This story can be found on [Panopto](https://dartmouth.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=98cb2b55-43e3-47c3-9ded-ae5a00785f1f)

The data in this story was analyzed using line plots, bar plots, and correlations to see where gas prices are most aligned with national averages.

The East Coast has gas prices most closely tied to the national average, but other factors are certainly at play.

# Downloading the data

Dataset provided by the US Energy Information Adminstration that includes weekly prices for various types of gas and diesel averaged over the country, region, select states, and select cities.

Dataset for supply of gasoline is also provided by the USEIA.

Similarly, the dataset for gasoline demand can be found [here](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_cons_psup_a_EPM0F_VPP_mbblpd_a.htm)

# Contributing to the code

This project suggests that gas prices on the East Coast are tied more strongly to the national average than those in any other regions of the country. While the correlation is not terrifically strong, there is also evidence to suggest that the demand on gasoline is more related to gas prices than supply in U.S. refineries. It is likely that causes beyond the scope of this data story impact the prices of gas and favor the East Coast in some economic measures.

To continue this project, future data researchers should continue using other measures of economic activity in the Petroleum Administration for Defense District regions to see if there are factors that can better predict gas prices. Analysis of this nature could be incredibly lucrative if used for investment purposes.
