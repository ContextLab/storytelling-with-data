 In Armorik, that called is Britayne,
Ther was a knyght that loved and dide his payne
To serve a lady in his beste wise;
And many a labour, many a greet emprise,
He for his lady wroghte, er she were wonne.
For she was oon the faireste under sonne,
And eek therto comen of so heigh kynrede
That wel unnethes dorste this knyght for drede
Telle hir his wo, his peyne, and his distresse.But atte laste, she for his worthynesse,And namely for his meke obeysaunce,Hath swiche a pitee caught of his penaunce,That pryvely she fil of his accordTo take hym for hir housbonde and hir lord,Of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves-And for to lede the moore in blisse hir lyves,Of his free wyl he swoor hir as a knyght,That nevere in al his lyf he, day ne nyght,Ne sholde upon hym take no maistrieAgayn hir wyl, ne kithe hir jalousie,But hir obeye and folwe hir wyl in alAs any lovere to his lady shal,Save that the name of soveraynetee,That wolde he have, for shame of his degree.      She thanked hym, and with ful greet humblesseShe seyde, "Sire, sith of youre gentillesseYe profre me to have so large a reyne,Ne wolde nevere God bitwixe us tweyne,As in my gilt, were outher werre or stryf.50Sir, I wol be youre humble trewe wyf,Have heer my trouthe til that myn herte breste."Thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste.       For o thyng, sires, saufly dar I seye,That freendes everych oother moot obeye,55If they wol longe holden compaignye.Love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye;Whan maistrie comth, the God of Love anonBeteth hise wynges, and farewel, he is gon!Love is a thyng as any spirit free.60Wommen, of kynde desiren libertee,And nat to been constreyned as a thral;And so doon men, if I sooth seyen shal.Looke who that is moost pacient in love,He is at his avantage al above.65Pacience is an heigh vertu, certeyn,For it venquysseth, as thise clerkes seyn,Thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne.For every word men may nat chide or pleyne,Lerneth to suffre, or elles, so moot I goon,70Ye shul it lerne, wherso ye wole or noon.For in this world, certein, ther no wight isThat he ne dooth or seith som tyme amys.Ire, siknesse, or constellaciounWyn, wo, or chaungynge of complexioun75Causeth ful ofte to doon amys or speken.On every wrong a man may nat be wreken;After the tyme moste be temperaunceTo every wight that kan on governaunce.And therfore hath this wise worthy knyght,80To lyve in ese, suffrance hir bihight,And she to hym ful wisly gan to swereThat nevere sholde ther be defaute in here.       Heere may men seen an humble wys accord!Thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord,85Servant in love, and lord in mariage;Thanne was he bothe in lordship and servage-Servage? Nay, but in lordshipe above,Sith he hath bothe his lady and his love-His lady, certes, and his wyf also,90The which that lawe of love acordeth to.And whan he was in this prosperitee,Hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree,Nat fer fro Pedmark, ther his dwellyng was,Where as he lyveth in blisse and in solas.95       Who koude telle, but he hadde wedded be,The joye, the ese, and the prosperiteeThat is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf?A yeer and moore lasted this blisful lyf,Til that the knyght of which I speke of thus,100That of Kayrrud was cleped Arveragus,Shoop hym to goon, and dwelle a yeer or tweyne,In Engelond, that cleped was eek Briteyne,To seke in armes worshipe and honour-For al his lust he sette in swich labour-105And dwelled there two yeer, the book seith thus.       Now wol I stynten of this Arveragus,And speken I wole of Dorigene his wyf,That loveth hir housbonde as hir hertes lyf.For his absence wepeth she and siketh,110As doon thise noble wyves whan hem liketh.She moorneth, waketh, wayleth, fasteth, pleyneth,Desir of his presence hir so destreyneth,That al this wyde world she sette at noght,Hir freendes whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght,115Conforten hir in al that ever they may.They prechen hir, they telle hir nyght and dayThat causelees she sleeth hirself, allas!And every confort possible in this casThey doon to hir, with all hir bisynesse,120Al for to make hir leve hir hevynesse.       By proces, as ye knowen everichoon,Men may so longe graven in a stoon,Til som figure therinne emprented be.So longe han they conforted hir, til she125Receyved hath by hope and by resounThe emprentyng of hir consolacioun,Thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage;She may nat alwey duren in swich rage.       And eek Arveragus, in al this care,130Hath sent hir lettres hoom of his welfare,And that he wol com hastily agayn,Or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn.       Hir freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake,And preyde hir on knees, for Goddes sake,135To com and romen hir in compaignye,Awey to dryve hir derke fantasye.And finally she graunted that requeste,For wel she saugh that it was for the beste.       Now stood hir castel faste by the see;140And often with hir freendes walketh sheHire to disporte, upon the bank an heigh,Where as she many a ship and barge seighSeillynge hir cours, where as hem liste go.But thanne was that a parcel of hir wo,145For to hirself ful ofte "Allas," seith she,"Is ther no ship of so many as I seWol bryngen hoom my lord? Thanne were myn herteAl warisshed of hisse bittre peynes smerte."       Another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thynke150And caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke;But whan she saugh the reisly rokkes blake,For verray feere, so wolde hir herte quakeThat on hire feet she myghte hir noght sustene.Thanne wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene,155And pitously into the see biholde,And seyn right thus, with sorweful sikes colde:       "Eterne God, that thurgh thy purveiaunceLedest the world by certein governaunce,In ydel, as men seyn, ye no thyng make.160But, lord, thise grisly feendly rokkes blake,That semen rather a foul confusiounOf werk, than any fair creaciounOf swich a parfit wys God and a stable,Why han ye wroght this werk unresonable?165For by this werk, south, north, ne west ne eestTher nys yfostred man, ne bryd, ne beest.It dooth no good, to my wit, but anoyeth,Se ye nat, lord, how mankynde it destroyeth?An hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde170Han rokkes slayn, al be they nat in mynde;Which mankynde is so fair part of thy werkThat thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk.Thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chierteeToward mankynde; but how thanne may it bee175That ye swiche meenes make it to destroyen,Whiche meenes do no good, but evere anoyen?I woot wel clerkes wol seyn, as hem leste,By argumentz, that al is for the beste,Though I ne kan the causes nat yknowe,180But thilke God that made wynd to bloweAs kepe my lord; this my conclusioun.To clerkes lete I al this disputisoun-But wolde God, that alle thise rokkes blake,Were sonken into helle for his sake!185Thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the feere!"Thus wolde she seyn, with many a pitous teere.       Hir freendes sawe that it was no disportTo romen by the see, but disconfort,And shopen for to pleyen somwher elles;190They leden hir by ryveres and by welles,And eek in othere places delitables;They dauncen, and they pleyen at ches and tables.       So on a day, right in the morwe tyde,Unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde,195In which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunceOf vitaille and of oother purveiaunce,They goon and pleye hem al the longe day.And this was in the sixte morwe of May,Which May hadde peynted with his softe shoures200This gardyn ful of leves and of floures,And craft of mannes hand so curiouslyArrayed hadde this gardyn trewely,That nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys,But if it were the verray Paradys.205The odour of floures and the fresshe sighteWolde han maked any herte lighteThat evere was born, but if to greet siknesseOr to greet sorwe helde it in distresse;So ful it was of beautee with plesaunce.210At after-dyner gonne they to daunceAnd synge also, save Dorigen allone,Which made alwey hir compleint and hir mooneFor she ne saugh hym on the daunce goThat was hir housbonde, and hir love also.215But nathelees she moste a tyme abyde,And with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde.       Upon this daunce, amonges othere men,Daunced a squier biforn DorigenThat fressher was, and jolyer of array,220As to my doom, than is the monthe of May.He syngeth, daunceth, passynge any manThat is or was, sith that the world bigan.Therwith he was, if men sholde hym discryve,Oon of the beste farynge man of lyve;225Yong, strong, right vertuous, and riche, and wys,And wel biloved, and holden in greet prys.And shortly, if the sothe I tellen shal,Unwityng of this Dorigen at al,This lusty squier, servant to Venus,230Which that ycleped was Aurelius,Hadde loved hir best of any creatureTwo yeer and moore, as was his aventure;But nevere dorste he tellen hir his grevaunce,Withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce.235He was despeyred, no thyng dorste he seyeSave in his songes somwhat wolde he wreyeHis wo, as in a general compleynyng.He seyde he lovede, and was biloved no thyng,Of swich matere made he manye layes,240Songes, compleintes, roundels, virelayes,How that he dorste nat his sorwe telle,But langwissheth, as a furye dooth in helle,And dye he moste, he seyde, as dide EkkoFor Narcisus, that dorste nat telle hir wo,245In oother manere than ye heere me seye,Ne dorste he nat to hir his wo biwreye,Save that paraventure som tyme at daunces,Ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces,It may wel be he looked on hir face,250In swich a wise as man that asketh grace;But nothyng wiste she of his entente.Nathelees it happed, er they thennes wente,By cause that he was hir neighebour,And was a man of worshipe and honour,255And hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore,They fille in speche, and forthe moore and mooreUnto this purpos drough Aurelius.And whan he saugh his tyme, he seyde thus:       "Madame," quod he, "by God that this world made,260So that I wiste it myghte your herte glade,I wolde that day that youre ArveragusWente over the see, that I, Aurelius,Hadde went ther nevere I sholde have come agayn.For wel I woot my servyce is in vayn,265My gerdoun is but brestyng of myn herte.Madame, reweth upon my peynes smerte,For with a word ye may me sleen or save.Heere at your feet, God wolde that I were grave,I ne have as now no leyser moore to seye,270Have mercy, sweete, or ye wol do me deye."       She gan to looke upon Aurelius:"Is this youre wyl!" quod she, "and sey ye thus?Nevere erst," quod she, "ne wiste I what ye mente.But now, Aurelie, I knowe youre entente.275By thilke God, that yaf me soule and lyf,Ne shal I nevere been untrewe wyf,In word ne werk, as fer as I have wit.I wol been his to whom that I am knyt.Taak this for fynal answere as of me."280But after that, in pley thus seyde she,       "Aurelie," quod she, "by heighe God above,Yet wolde I graunte yow to been youre love,Syn I yow se so pitously complayne.Looke, what day that endelong Britayne285Ye remoeve alle the rokkes, stoon by stoon,That they ne lette shipe ne boot to goon, -I seye, whan ye han maad the coost so cleneOf rokkes that ther nys no stoon ysene,Thanne wol I love yow best of any man,290Have heer my trouthe in al that evere I kan."       "Is ther noon oother grace in yow?" quod he.       "No, by that lord," quod she, "that maked me;For wel I woot that it shal nevere bityde;Lat swiche folies out of your herte slyde.295What deyntee sholde a man han in his lyfFor to go love another mannes wyf,That hath hir body whan so that hym liketh?"       Aurelius ful ofte soore siketh,Wo was Aurelie, whan that he this herde,300And with a sorweful herte he thus answered.       "Madame," quod he, "this were an inpossible;Thanne moot I dye of sodeyn deth horrible."And with that word he turned hym anon.Tho coome hir othere freendes many oon,305And in the aleyes romeden up and doun,And nothyng wiste of this conclusioun,But sodeynly bigonne revel newe,Til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe,For th'orisonte hath reft the sonne his lyght -310This is as muche to seye as it was nyght -And hoom they goon in joye and in solas,Save oonly wrecche Aurelius, allas!He to his hous is goon with sorweful herte;He seeth he may nat fro his deeth asterte;315Hym semed that he felte his herte colde;Up to the hevene hise handes he gan holde,And on hise knowes bare he sette hym doun,And in his ravyng seyde his orisoun.For verray wo out of his wit he breyde;320He nyste what he spak, but thus he seyde:With pitous herte his pleynt hath he bigonneUnto the goddes, and first unto the sonne       He seyde, "Appollo, god and governourOf every plaunte, herbe, tree, and flour325That yevest after thy declinaciounTo ech of hem his tyme and his sesoun,As thyn herberwe chaungeth lowe or heighe,Lord Phebus, cast thy mericiable eigheOn wrecche Aurelie, which that am but lorn.330Lo, lord, my lady hath my deeth yswornWithoute gilt, but thy benignyteeUpon my dedly herte have som pitee.For wel I woot, lord Phebus, if yow lest,Ye may me helpen, save my lady, best.335Now voucheth sauf that I may yow devyseHow that I may been holpen and in what wyse.       "Your blisful suster, Lucina the sheene,That of the see is chief goddesse and queene,(Though Neptunus have deitee in the see,340Yet emperisse aboven hym is she),Ye knowen wel, lord, that right as hir desirIs to be quyked and lightned of youre fir,For which she folweth yow ful bisily,Right so the see desireth naturelly345To folwen hir, as she that is goddesseBothe in the see and ryveres moore and lesse.Wherfore, lord Phebus, this is my requeste -Do this miracle, or do myn herte breste, -That now next at this opposicioun350Which in the signe shal be of the Leoun,As preieth hir, so greet a flood to bryngeThat fyve fadme at the leeste it overspryngeThe hyeste rokke in Armorik Briteyne,And lat this flood endure yeres tweyne.355Thanne, certes, to my lady may I seye'Holdeth youre heste, the rokkes been aweye.'       Lord Phebus, dooth this miracle for me,Preye hir she go no faster cours than ye.I seye, preyeth your suster that she go360No faster cours than ye thise yeres two.Thanne shal she been evene atte fulle alway;And spryng flood laste bothe nyght and day;And but she vouche sauf in swich manereTo graunte me my sovereyn lady deere,365Prey hir to synken every rok adounInto hir owene dirke regiounUnder the ground ther Pluto dwelleth inne,Or nevere mo shal I my lady wynne.Thy temple in Delphos wol I barefoot seke,370Lord Phebus; se the teeris on my cheke,And of my peyne have som compassioun!"And with that word in swowne he fil adoun,And longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce.       His brother, which that knew of his penaunce,375Up caughte hym, and to bedde he hath hym broght.Dispeyred in this torment and this thoghtLete I this woful creature lye;Chese he for me wheither he wol lyve or dye.       Arveragus, with heele and greet honour,380As he that was of chivalrie the flour,Is comen hoom, and othere worthy men.O blisful artow now, thou Dorigen!That hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes,The fresshe knyght, the worthy man or armes,385That loveth thee, as his owene hertes lyf.No thyng list hym to been ymaginatyfIf any wight hadde spoke, whil he was oute,To hire of love; he hadde of it no doute,He noght entendeth to no swich mateere,390But daunceth, justeth, maketh hir good cheere,And thus in joye and blisse I lete hem dwelle,And of the sike Aurelius I wol telle.       In langour and in torment furyesTwo yeer and moore lay wrecche Aurelyus,395Er any foot he myghte on erthe gon;Ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon,Save of his brother, which that was a clerk.He knew of al this wo and al this werk;For to noon oother creature, certeyn,400Of this matere he dorste no word seyn.Under his brest he baar it moore secreeThan evere dide Pamphilus for Galathee.His brest was hool withoute for to sene,But in his herte ay was the arwe kene.405And wel ye knowe that of a sursanureIn surgerye is perilous the cure,But men myghte touche the arwe, or come therby.His brother weep and wayled pryvely,Til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce410That whiles he was at Orliens in Fraunce,As yonge clerkes, that been lykerousTo reden artes that been curious,Seken in every halke and every herneParticular sciences for to lerne, -415He hym remembred, that upon a dayAt Orliens in studie a book he sayOf magyk natureel, which his felawe,That was that tyme a bacheler of lawe-Al were he ther to lerne another craft,420Hadde prively upon his desk ylaft;Which book spak muchel of the operaciouns,Touchynge the eighte and twenty mansiounsThat longen to the moone, and swich folyeAs in oure dayes is nat worth a flye, -425For hooly chirches feith in oure bileveNe suffreth noon illusioun us to greve.And whan this book was in his remembraunce,Anon for joye his herte gan to daunce,And to hymself he seyde pryvely,430"My brother shal be warisshed hastily;For I am siker that ther be sciencesBy whiche men make diverse apparencesSwiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye;For ofte at feestes have I wel herd seye435That tregetoures withinne an halle largeHave maad come in a water and a barge,And in the halle rowen up and doun.Somtyme hath semed come a grym leoun;And somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede,440Somtyme a vyne, and grapes white and rede,Somtyme a castel al of lym and stoon;And whan hem lyked, voyded it anoon,Thus semed it to every mannes sighte.       Now thanne conclude I thus, that if I myghte445At Orliens som oold felawe yfyndeThat hadde this moones mansions in mynde,Or oother magyk natureel above,He sholde wel make my brother han his love;For with an apparence a clerk may make450To mannes sighte, that alle the rokkes blakeOf Britaigne weren yvoyded everichon,And shippes by the brynke comen and gon,And in swich forme enduren a wowke or two.Thanne were my brother warisshed of his wo;455Thanne moste she nedes holden hire biheste,Or elles he shal shame hire atte leste."       What sholde I make a lenger tale of this?Unto his brotheres bed he comen is,And swich confort he yaf hym for to gon460To Orliens that he up stirte anon,And on his wey forthward thanne is he fareIn hope for to been lissed of his care.       Whan they were come almoost to that citee,But if it were a furlong or three,465A yong clerk romynge by hymself they mette,Which that in Latyn thriftily hem grette,And after that he seyde a wonder thyng:"I knowe," quod he, "the cause of youre comyng."And er they ferther any foote wente,470He tolde hem al that was in hire entente.       This Briton clerk hym asked of felawesThe whiche that he had knowe in olde dawes,And he answerde hym that they dede were,For which he weep ful ofte many a teere.475       Doun of his hors Aurelius lighte anon,And with this magicien forth is he gonHoom to his hous, and maden hem wel at ese.Hem lakked no vitaille that myghte hem plese.So wel arrayed hous as ther was oon480Aurelius in his lyf saugh nevere noon.       He shewed hym, er he wente to sopeer,Forestes, parkes ful of wilde deer;Ther saugh he hertes with hir hornes hye,The gretteste that evere were seyn with ye.485He saugh of hem an hondred slayn with houndes,And somme with arwes blede of bittre woundes.He saugh, whan voyded were thise wilde deer,Thise fauconers upon a fair ryver,That with hir haukes han the heron slayn.490       Tho saugh he knyghtes justyng in a playn;And after this he dide hym swich plesaunceThat he hym shewed his lady on a daunce,On which hymself he daunced, as hym thoughte.And whan this maister that his magyk wroughte495Saugh it was tyme, he clapte his handes two,And farewel! al oure revel was ago.And yet remoeved they nevere out of the hous,Whil they saugh al this sighte marveillous,But in his studie, ther as his bookes be,500They seten stille, and no wight but they thre.       To hym this maister called his squier,And seyde hym thus: "Is redy oure soper?Almoost an houre it is, I undertake,Sith I yow bad oure soper for to make,505Whan that thise worthy men wenten with meInto my studie, ther as my bookes be."       "Sire," quod this squier, "whan it liketh yow,It is al redy, though ye wol right now.""Go we thanne soupe," quod he, "as for the beste.510Thise amorous folk somtyme moote han hir reste."       At after-soper fille they in treteeWhat somme sholde this maistres gerdon be,To remoeven alle the rokkes of Britayne,And eek from Gerounde to the mouth of Sayne515       He made it straunge, and swoor, so God hym save,Lasse than a thousand pound he wolde nat have,Ne gladly for that somme he wolde nat goon.       Aurelius, with blisful herte anoon,Answerde thus: "Fy on a thousand pound!520This wyde world, which that men seye is round,I wolde it yeve, if I were lord of it.This bargayn is ful dryve, for we been knyt.Ye shal be payed trewely, by my throuthe!But looketh now for no necligence or slouthe525Ye tarie us heere, no lenger than to-morwe."       "Nay," quod this clerk, "have heer my feith to borwe.'       To bedde is goon Aurelius whan hym leste,And wel ny al that nyght he hadde his reste;What for his labour and his hope of blisse,530His woful herte of penaunce hadde a lisse.       Upon the morwe, whan that it was day,To Britaigne tooke they the righte way,Aurelius and this magicien bisyde,And been descended ther they wolde abyde.535And this was, as thise bookes me remembre,The colde, frosty sesoun of Decembre.       Phebus wax old, and hewed lyk latoun,That in this hoote declynaciounShoon as the burned gold, and stremes brighte;540But now in Capricorn adoun he lighte,Where as he shoon ful pale, I dar wel seyn.The bittre frostes, with the sleet and reyn,Destroyed hath the grene in every yerd;Janus sit by the fyr, with double berd,545And drynketh of his bugle horn the wyn.Biforn hym stant brawen of the tusked swyn,And "Nowel" crieth every lusty man.       Aurelius, in al that evere he kan,Dooth to his master chiere and reverence,550And preyeth hym to doon his diligenceTo bryngen hym out of his peynes smerte,Or with a swerd that he wolde slitte his herte.       This subtil clerk swich routhe had of this man,That nyght and day he spedde hym that he kan555To wayten a tyme of his conclusioun,This is to seye, to maken illusiounBy swich an apparence or jogelrye -I ne kan no termes of

wolde she nevere go,685No wight ne myghte hir handes of it arace,Til she was slayn right in the selve place.       Now sith that maydens hadden swich despit,To been defouled with mannes foul delit,Wel oghte a wyf rather hirselven slee,690Than be defouled, as it thynketh me.What shal I seyn of Hasdrubales wyfThat at Cartage birafte hirself hir lyf?For whan she saugh that

rather sleen myself in som manere,As dide Demociones doghter deere,By cause that she wolde nat defouled be.720O Cedasus, it is ful greet piteeTo reden how thy doghtren deyde, allas,That

nyghtHoom cam Arveragus, this worthy knyght,And asked hir why that she weep so soore.And she gan wepen ever lenger the moore.755"Allas!" quod she, "that evere I was born.Thus have I seyd," quod she, "thus have I sworn" -And toold hym al as ye han herd bifore,It nedeth nat reherce it yow namoore.This housbonde with glad chiere in freendly wyse760Answerde and seyde, as I shal yow devyse,"Is ther oght elles, Dorigen, but this?"       "Nay, nay," quod she, "God helpe me so, as wys,This is to muche, and it were Goddes wille.""Ye, wyf," quod he, "lat slepen that is stille.765It may be wel paraventure yet to-day.Ye shul youre trouthe holden, by my fay.For God so wisly have mercy upon me,I hadde wel levere ystiked for to beFor verray love which that I to yow have,770But if ye sholde your trouthe kepe and save.Trouthe is the hyeste thyng that man may kepe."But with that word he brast anon to wepeAnd seyde, "I yow forbede, up peyne of deeth,That nevere whil thee lasteth lyf ne breeth,775To no wight telle thou of this aventure -As I may best, I wol my wo endure, -Ne make no contenance of hevynesse,That folk of yow may demen harm or gesse."       And forth he cleped a squier and a mayde;780"Gooth forth anon with Dorigen," he sayde,"And bryngeth hir to swich a place anon,"They take hir leve, and on hir wey they gon,But they ne weste why she thider wente,He nolde no wight tellen his entente.785       Paraventure, an heep of yow, ywis,Wol holden hym a lewed man in this,That he wol putte his wyf in jupartie.Herkneth the tale er ye upon hire crie;She may have bettre fortune than yow semeth,790And whan that ye han herd the tale, demeth.       This squier, which that highte Aurelius,On Dorigen that was so amorus,Of aventure happed hir to meeteAmydde the toun, right in the quykkest strete,795As she was bown to goon the wey forth-rightToward the gardyn, ther as she had hight.And he was to the gardyn-ward also,For wel he spyed whan she wolde goOut of hir hous to any maner place.800But thus they mette, of aventure or graceAnd he saleweth hir with glad entente,And asked of hir whiderward she wente.And she answerde, half as she were mad,"Unto the gardyn as myn housbonde bad,805My trouthe for to holde, allas! allas!"       Aurelius gan wondren on this cas,And in his herte hadde greet compassiounOf hir and of hir lamentacioun,And of Arveragus, the worthy knyght,810That bad hire holden al that she had hight,So looth hym was his wyf sholde breke hir trouthe;And in his herte he caughte of this greet routhe,Considerynge the beste on every sydeThat fro his lust yet were hym levere abyde815Than doon so heigh a cherlyssh wrecchednesseAgayns franchise and alle gentillesse.-For which in fewe wordes seyde he thus:       "Madame, seyeth to your lord Arveragus,That sith I se his grete gentillesse820To yow, and eek I se wel youre distresse,That him were levere han shame - and that were routhe -Than ye to me sholde breke thus youre trouthe,I have wel levere evere to suffre woThan I departe the love bitwix yow two.825I yow relesse, madame, into youre hondQuyt every surement and every bond,That ye han maad to me as

thonketh hym upon hir knees al bare,And hoom unto hir housbonde is she fare,And tolde hym al, as ye han herd me sayd;840And be ye siker, he was so weel apaydThat it were inpossible me to

though she were a queene,And she was to hym trewe for everemoore.-Of thise two folk ye gete of me namoore.       Aurelius, that his cost hath al forlorn850Curseth the tyme that evere he was born."Allas," quod he, "allas, that I bihighteOf pured gold a thousand pound of wighteUnto this philosophre!
