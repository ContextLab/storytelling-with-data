0,Leofwine_draca,A new TV classic,10/10,9 October 2021,"Just finished up SQUID GAME, the Korean TV show that's become a global smash hit on Netflix. It's truly brilliant and even better than the similar Japanese show ALICE IN BORDERLAND! The show is centred around contestants competing in children's games for a cash prize, but the twist is that they get killed if they lose. Shades of SAW and THE HUNGER GAMES here, but this is rivalled only by BATTLE ROYALE in terms of sheer quality. As usual for Korea, the writing, acting, and direction are all superb and the games themselves are hugely suspenseful, unlike anything I've seen before. Definitely horrifying enough both in premise and in terms of violent bloodshed to count as horror too.

1,kosmasp,Just a game,9/10,10 October 2021,"Well multiple games actually, but even that you may find ... not accurate. Now you may not look the same way at some games that are being played here. But with all the buzz right now, you've probably heard quite a bit about that already.If like you got into this without any spoilers (congrats by the way), then the show will be able to surprise quite a few times. Be it by the players themselves but also and even more so by how the story evolves. It may not end exactly how I would imagine ... but that can also be seen as a good thing I reckon.As a fan of Korean cinema I was curious about this anyway. And it did not dissapoint - at all. The acting is amazing, the effects are great ... and the story is as mature as it can get. With enough social commentary and critique to make this a great watch!

2,Tweekums,Games to die for,10/10,11 October 2021,"This runaway hit from South Korea is centred on Seong Gi-hun, a heavily indebted man who is invited to take part in a series of six games that if he wins will solve his problems. He accepts gets into a vehicle where a gas puts him to sleep. When he wakes he is in a large facility with over four hundred other people; they are watched over by masked armed guards. Here they are told the rules, one of which states that if a majority of players want to quit the game will end but they will not get any prize money. As they play the first game, the school yard game 'red light green light' they quickly learn that being eliminated is quite literal with losers being shot on the spot! Over the course of the series Gi-hun gets to know various other contestants; some he befriends and forms a team with for certain games; others are quickly identified as a danger. As the games continue more and more people are eliminated. While this is going on a policeman, looking for his missing brother, has found his way to the facility and, having taken the place of a guard, it trying to uncover what happened to his brother and who is behind the activities there.When I saw this recommended on Netflix I thought I'd watch it sometime but was in no great rush as I assumed to would be a Korean 'Alice in Borderland'. After hearing talk of its popularity I thought perhaps I should watch it sooner. I'm glad that I did. I really liked 'Alice in Borderland' but this is so much better, and while there are some similarities there are very important differences. There is a real sense of danger from the moment the first game begins; the fact that the contestants are playing playground games rather than deviously clever made up games make it feel strangely more real. The games are nicely varied; requiring skill, strength and sometimes just luck. The characters are the series real strength; they are varied and the way they are introduced means that the viewer grows to really care about them, especially as we learn certain players motivation for playing such a deadly game. The programme's design is impressive; I especially liked the masked look of those running the game facility. The cast does a really fine job bringing their characters to life and the sets and effects are impressive. Overall I'd definitely recommend this... watch it before you learn too much about what happens.These comments are based on watching the series in Korean with English subtitles.

3,FeastMode,"if you think this is good, PLEASE watch the korean movie Oldboy",5/10,9 October 2021,"I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about it other than being a korean series. And yet i found it annoyingly predictable with almost nothing surprising me. Maybe i've just seen too many movies, but i've seen this all before. And i think what a lot of ppl like about this show is the norm in korean cinema. But most casuals have never watched a korean movie (if so, you're missing out, only thing that comes close to hollywood-level quality)i mentioned it in my title, but if you loved this series and are shocked by my low rating, please please please watch oldboy (not the american remake). It's superior in every way imaginable and an amazing movieoverall, this was an okay show. I was really into it at first, but it seemed to decline after the halfway point. By the end, i was feeling minimal impact from the big moments, and during the last episode i just wanted it to finish. There's a lot of good here, but many negatives as well. See below.Things that bothered me (without spoilers)-a scene that could have been really cool but they full-on strobe lighted it so you couldn't see anything-a ridiculously annoying female character (the older one), biggest offense is the eye-rolling bathroom scene-some really questionable decisions, some to the point of angering me-characters asking moronic questions or being outraged at things that they can't possibly still be outraged aboutthe games start out creative with skill, talent and strategy involved, but become random and filled with luck-the laughable acting and dialogue for all of the english scenes. This is the norm for asian cinema, but that doesn't mean it can always be forgiven. It was AWFUL. Can't they hire any experienced american actor? Or an english dialogue correspondent?-i like when a movie is the right kind of weird, the kind that makes it feel unique and adds character. But a lot of the weird in this show seemed to be there solely for the sake of being weird.-there were SO many times where i knew exactly what was going to happen next."
4,Irishchatter,It started off strong but ended disoriented,7/10,8 October 2021,"I honestly don't know wtf the main character needed to go into the room where the old man was, dye his hair red and not attempting to board the plane. At the beginning I was having expectations that it would be thrillingly good which it was but the ending just didn't do it for me chief....

6,John6Daniels,This puts a smile on my face.,1/10,15 October 2021,"Haha! I don't know if it's Korea, trolls, fanboys, sheep or IMDb. Now I have 5 reviews gone. A pointless review has become a threat to humanity, it seems. Haha! The next Netflix show should be about a review that triggers people. If Squid Game can sale this movie would sell too.I don't know what to write anymore. Okay. I'll lie. It's the American thing to do, and that is lie. Everyone loves a lie that sounds nice.10 = 100This show was so good because it was boring, and I felt stupid watching it. The voice work felt so natural. I liked how Tarzan Cameo'd and saved the people in the end. Believe the hype. I hope there will be a season 2 of this great show.The show is about a bunch of people dying, and it made me feel happy and smarted up. Squid Game was very entertaining.Last Words: Squid Game rules!!

7,RosanaBotafogo,"Perfect, Beautiful and lovely...",10/10,12 October 2021,"Ep1 wonderful drama that we love, protagonist of dubious character, we didn't even root for him, but I loved his rambunctious behavior, Chips 1, 2, 3, bizarre in the way we love... T2 more drama than blood, we love it too... Ep4 Loving the jokes of macabre and bloodthirsty children, catching love for the characters, and hatred for the villains...
Ep 6 the construction of the characters was perfect, the games give a sarcastic and sadistic tone, however the dialogues are the high point, with that black humor that the Koreans do so well, the conversations between the characters are intelligent, with a quick script, everything very captivating and mesmerizing, the players and the undercover cop, showing the other side of the game... Lovely..
Ep 6 And the marbles game brought me a few tears, this was the game where the most innocent characters die, like the Pakistani who just wanted money to help his family who stayed there, his naivety and trust cost him his life , and the girl who killed the father who will kill her mother, and who has just got out of prison, and in the end gives up the game for her partner, perfect scenarios...
I finished Round 6, completely in love, I already loved Korean movies, it just came to reaffirm their competence, perfect, everything perfect, I loved the dialogues, super mesmerizing script, the perfect effects, everything great in this production, I even cried... Beautiful, beautiful... But I saw many truths there, in real life it would be more or less like this...

8,billcr12,Addicting,8/10,14 October 2021,"A great concept here as desperate people with financial problems compete for a huge sum of money(apparently $38 mil American). They must play games against one another with a severe penalty for losing. Like the Sopranos, with some of the episodes better than others. Number six was the best for me. The sets are Wes Anderson like, with bright colors filling the screen. The lead actors are excellent and the scripts very well written. The violence is over the top with no comic relief in sight. The final episode was a bit of a letdown but overall I was highly entertained.

9,alindsay-al,A Fantastic truly unique show,9/10,10 October 2021,"So Squid Game has taken over the world these last few weeks and I thought that I had to watch it and I have now finished it and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a large group of down on there luck Koreans assembled to play childhood games with a deadly twist for a huge cash prize.Main Character
Lee Jung-Jae plays the lead character Gi-Han on the show and he is fantastic. At first he seems like this arrogant lowlife, but as you get to know him you see that he has just been really unfortunate and made some poor decisions. As he faces the games his character really starts to grow and he becomes an interesting protagonist and one you can support.Supporting Characters
There is a huge cast of people in this show and everybody acts there role really well. Oh Yeong-su really stands out as an old man involved with the game and the relationship between him and Lee Jung-Jae is superb and I really grew to care about this dynamic and for me they were the best characters on the show. There are so many other amazing characters that I think you just need to watch the show and experience them for yourself and the great writing that is done for each person.Story
The story is fascinating, seeing these different personalities forced into these games causes natural conflict and tension. The different games are really great in there own unique ways and do a really brilliant job of pacing them out really well. The only issue I had was a big twist that happens towards the end of the show, it just didn't work for me and I think it could have been handled better. Also there are these English speaking VIP's and they are really bad and took me out of the show for sure.Script
The script is fantastic, and that is if you watch it in Korean with subtitles. For the love of everything holy don't watch it with English dubbing, it is bad and it is nowhere near as effective and feels unnatural for the performances. There is some nice humour and the drama is ramped up ten fold, the chemistry between the performers is really good and drives you to keep watching.Style
The show is really brutal, the violence is graphic but feels appropriate for the show as a whole. It is shot beautifully and feels epic in scale. The pacing is effective and you will want to binge this show for sure with each episode feeling different and great in there own way.Overall
Overall, Squid Game is a truly fantastic show that was so close to getting my 10/10 score. It is a must watch and don't let the language barrier turn you off and get started with it as soon as possible."
10,andrewchristianjr,"A TRUE SOCIAL COMMENTARY ON HUMANITY, COMPETITION, AND AVARICE.",8/10,29 September 2021,"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.

12,dwp1948,An Excellent New Korean Series Concept Viewers Enjoy - Highly Recommended,10/10,24 September 2021,"09/23/2021 The first few episodes were fun to watch as they played out but as the series progressed, a more serious, ominous storyline starts to unfold due to viewers empatheticly connecting with a few of the characters facing uncertainty as the game continues, even possible death? I found the series in the overall really great, refreshingly new and well planned out as it unfolded. I hope that somehow the series will continue on into the future with many more seasons to come? A great show from my perspective!

13,qui_j,Korean Soap Opera meets Hunger Games,8/10,6 October 2021,"This is an entertaining series from South Korea that embodies elements of Korean Soap Opera, Chinese Operatic acting and Japanese theater. It uses classical Chinese opera techniques such as the wide open eyes to portray fear and anger....and a lot of shouting.It uses ""Hunger Games"" as it's base and survival of the fittest as its main theme. The story is well crafted but unfortunately starts to lose its grip on reality by about episode 4. It then slides into a lot of moralizing and philosophical conversations that culminates in the final episode. It is set up for a second season (if one can judge from the final episode) but runs the risk of becoming very formula driven Have to agree with the other comments about the group of ""actors"" playing the VIPs. They obviously came cheap and might not even have been actors at all! Enjoyable for what it's meant to be!

Rich bored gamblers making desperate humans kill each other for their enjoyment.I guess the difference between this and so many before is the excellent character development and talented acting. Direction, cinematography all good. I think Alice in Borderland was slightly more adventurous but this was certainly slicker.A great binge watch!

18,gedikreverdi,Children's games have never been this exciting,8/10,11 October 2021,"I don't know if it's a must for Netflix shows to become lame at the very end. It became very far-fetched and melodramatic and Gi-hun signaled virtue the whole time as if he didn't get back to the game while he knew he had to kill people and as if he didn't cheat the old man at the marble game. I wish he just stood up and admitted what he did. His mother died and he helped the mother of the other finalist (that stabbed himself in the neck at the squid game) by giving her the money and then took the North Korean girl's brother from the orphanage and before flying to the US to see his daughter, he called the corporate again to make them pay back. And another thing is that the old man was in fact the Korean Jigsaw in the game. He was rich so he wanted to lose track of time just like he'd do when he was a child so he did all what he did. And he died at an empty flat right before the sleeping old drunk man in the street received help just like Gi-hun. He died a few seconds before midnight as if we needed more far-fetched stuff.I enjoyed the show except for the final episode. The idea and the execution was good and the acting didn't take me out of it except for the actors who play American guests. I like the characters and their background stories. And on top of all this, there's this amazing episode 6 so I rated it 8 out of 10.

20,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Fun Horror Show,7/10,7 October 2021,"I had fun binging for two days. It's seems like a mashup of the Hunger Games, Saw, Bond villains and wacky Asian reality game show. Very good character development. I felt I knew the characters well halfway in the series. The first two episodes are a little slow, then the show ramps up to speed. The last episode is a tear jerker. The weakest part, as many have said we're the VIPs. It wasn't that their acting was bad, it was the screenplay dialogue was poorly written.It's certainly a different kind of watch most Americans are not used to. But that's a good thing. Netflix makes it easier to watch foreign content so that our cultural bobble burst and we get more diversely made content from around the globe.

21,Movi3DO,Intense and entertaining thriller,8/10,23 September 2021,"Fly Me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season."
22,djurrepower,good,7/10,9 October 2021,"Most of the characters are very well written, sadly I can't say the same about the story. A lot of plotholes, and just overall sruff that didn't make sense. But apart from that, most aspects are pretty much fine. So all in all, an above average series but certainly not great or anything.7/10: good but not great.

23,SoumikBanerjee25,The Writing Steals the Limelight here.,8/10,8 October 2021,"""You don't trust people because they are trustworthy. You do it because you have nothing else to rely on""Squid Game is thoughtful, provocative, and darn productive in every sense. Still, I would refrain from labeling it as some 'Masterpiece'. Contrary to popular belief, it's not perfect. Trust me, it has its fair share of flaws just like others do. Yes, there are certain areas where it beats all our expectations, especially compare to all those series that had shared similar concepts before; yet, the deficiencies are a bit difficult to disregard whatsoever.If you ask me to recapitulate my impression in a single sentence, I would say; this is a well-acted, terrifically communicated (albeit outstretched) piece of work that would have no complications in attaining its unique set of audience (and judging by the current numbers, it already gathered enough).I love how they upheld a certain amount of credibility and constancy in their dissertation throughout these nine episodes. All the Social/Political innuendo makes it even more so worthy I reckon. Even though I shouldn't be discussing all these in detail as I do not see myself sufficiently qualified to make an argumentative critique on the differences that are ever-present between Capitalist & Communist ideologies. Instead, I'm leaning towards a more humane/psychological side of it.All these characters, personalities, come alongside their own set of guilts, motivations, purposes; a fascinating take on the human psyche, that is relatable on so many levels. Thus, their persistence and misery convey absolute legitimacy. And if you dare to take a closer look, the revelations might shock and terrify, as this is nothing but a reflective image of the society we all live in.From deliberately exposing the survivalist, ruthless instincts that are embedded deep in our subconscious since the beginning of our kind to showcasing this horrible world that is fraught with Greed, Expectations, and Disparities. This series undoubtedly has tremendous depth in its underlying messaging, more than anybody could ever imagine.In the end, the show poses a stern challenge against the very foundation of humanity or should I say the moralities of it. Furthermore, it begs the question; what it takes to be a human being? And are we even entitled to call ourselves one?"
24,bshaef,"Overall, an excellent series",9/10,7 October 2021,"But there were some plot holes. The cop should have been caught ten times before he died but he magically escaped or the scene just went out.Also, I never understood the organ harvester, where he came from and how he was able to ply his trade...But I really enjoyed the series except of a couple of the later episodes where there was an inordinate amount of blah blah blah.

25,aboalhyjaa,For those who didn't understand **,8/10,23 September 2021,"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.

27,Dragonborn64,Good Though Certainly Not Original,7/10,2 October 2021,"I mean, I'd say I liked The Hunger Games better - but not The Maze Runner. There's a real grimness to The Squid Games. Like The Platform. With every episode you're ground down deeper just like these poor saps who find themselves there. I liked it well enough though it was long and the characters pretty familiar to this genre. It does makes many apt comments about contemporary society - Ali's story is particularly sad as is Sae- Byeok's and the way we treat people just seeking a better life. I can't say I get the uproar of the series - Netflix's potential biggest- but it's worth a watch if you like dystopian stuff - and who doesn't?

29,AvionPrince16,Nice TV show with some great moments,8/10,8 October 2021,"Squid game is a great TV show and talk about a big problem in society and this is about money. The TV show talk about this theme trough all the episodes and how far will go someone without money and how far will go someone with money. I enjoyed the TV show: it have some great moments and heartbreaking sometimes. Some mysteries also and some big revelations. I enjoyed also the end who have more a psychological point and a different perspective of why they did all the stuff arround the squid game and i found it pretty believable and great to watch. I will recommend anyone to watch this TV Show. It was quite good.

36,shanayneigh,Mixtape algorithm,4/10,25 September 2021,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long."
37,AJ_McAninch,Over-hyped Netflix Production,6/10,5 October 2021,"Hype that will not stand up with time. This series does not measure up to the standards of good, much less great, Korean Drama. The cast is excellent, of course (except for the VIPs, though the inside joke on American actors is rich), but the plot is predictable from the beginning through to the end. From the moment 001 (the old man's number is a heavy-handed hint) showed up, the repetition mixed in with violence and gore was evident, and the outcome was always predictable.However. Blessings on Netflix for bringing international film to the world, especially during the pandemic. But don't try to own it, guys: just stream it.

It's just the vision of its creators - and that's fresh nowadays.I know people complain about the ending, but if you watch Alice in Borderlands (which you should, it's also a great show, Japanese this time) you'll know what a bad ending really is. That show didn't end with any conclusion.But Squid Game, trust me, it will have more seasons due to its success, but even if it didn't, it ended nicely, pretty much answering most questions and delivering good conclusions to everything. If anything, I believe more seasons would ruin this, but let's see what happens.In any case, the hype is real, this is a good show you should watch, just don't expect groundbreaking character development or much originality. The characters are mostly cliches we've seen before, and so is the concept of deadly games.But, again, the standards are low nowadays, and this show is just captivating and interesting enough to raise above everything else there is to watch right now."
40,tesswysko,"The Further I Get In The Series, The More OBVIOUS It Becomes That This Is A DOPPELGANGER of ""Animal World!""",6/10,14 October 2021,"Animal World is in my top 10 all-time favorite movies, largely because it was truly an ORIGINAL plot & was so well executed! I love it for it's ORIGINALITY. The further along this series gets, the more I'm starting to enjoy it, but also it's becoming an IRREFUTABLE doppelganger of ""Animal World!"" From the debt, the transportation of the contestants, the Mom who's going into the hospital for serious health issues and he can't pay for it, the main character blowing his money on betting & being a child-like burden on his elderly Mom, signing away his Mom's house, the friend who betrayed him (when he knew what the candy-cutting game was) even knowing his friend will likely die and he had multiple opportunities to clue him in, the fact that they're way out on an island (cruise ship) where no one would expect them to be & couldn't find them, even to the organ harvesting! On AW, some losers were also used for live human experimentation! I'm pretty sure I've had the plot-twist figured out for the last few episodes, so they've hooked me enough to keep watching until I know if I'm right or wrong. It's a GREAT idea for a movie/show, so I can understand why someone would want to do something SIMILAR, but do it CREATIVELY DIFFERENT! Especially with a 9 episode show, you have the opportunity & air time to take the idea and run with it! Don't use a movie like a precise blueprint, that's just plagiarism! So, because i love the premise so much, I'm hooked and have to see it to the end, even if it irritates me!

But it still felt that it was not finished as it should have been ended, with an open ending hinting for Season 2 (Although I would have preferred this to end in a single season).

47,laragi,All except the last episode,7/10,22 September 2021,"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again.

48,dumsumdumfai,Lord of the Flies x A man for all seasons...and one more,10/10,10 October 2021,"Yes, it's like the Japanese game genres like Liars Game, Death Note...etc but much more interesting characters and social commentary.Yes, in its core a social experiment like Lord of the Flies but then the main character is from A Man for all Seasons. The show basically ask do you have a price? The main guy, although a gambler, stayed true to himself as a nice person, believes in the goodness of humanity. Even though he won, he was much troubled by the lives lost, disgusted by the money, and dumbfounded by the ""reasoning"" behind it all.001, the number one man(1% of the world?) is basically echoing the sentiment of ""rosebud"" from Citizen Kane and laments the place where adults can never return to...childhood. But do you think Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson would have watched this show? (Maybe Elon Musk). Na, they have a space race to run.This is a great series. Detail oriented, simple games, thoughtful interactions, tense and full of all the character arch (good, bad and ugly) of humanity. Great cinematography, bgm score, character development, set, production and plot.The final game on the island is not a game but a duel of values. And ask again, will you true to yourself? Same with the last bet on his death bed from the old men. But the irony is that he lost not only the bet but also his life. Double irony that he didn't get to see the results.Do you believe in the goodness of humanity?

49,TheVictoriousV,A masterclass with only a few hiccups,8/10,12 October 2021,"I tend to argue that when South Korean creators are at their peak, they're giving 150%. This intensity and occasional brutality (these works hold back neither in terms of raw emotions being expressed nor the violence being depicted) means that films like Secret Sunshine and Oldboy, while close to flawless, don't necessarily find pop-culture success the world over.But we live in different times, and the world is about to realize that there is more to South Korean media than bouncy BTS videos, more so than when Parasite arrived and gave the Korean Wave a considerable push. For all their problems, we can thank Netflix for this -- once again they grant something truly special and creative a platform.I was incredibly excited to watch Squid Game, even though I at first deemed it ""suspiciously popular"". What was it? One of those rare pieces of media that's clever, unique, and layered enough to please smart viewers but accessible enough to be ""hip"", or a preachy, obvious miniseries that blew the minds of those who haven't seen this type of art yet? (Or maybe those who only watched it because Korean media is the current ""cool"" thing to consume and didn't grasp the larger point -- there are articles that smugly point out things that don't make sense about the setting, which, as per the show's themes and social satire, aren't supposed to make sense).Ultimately, Squid Game (original title Ojing-eo Geim) proved to mostly be the former. That is, a piece of pop-culture art that works on one level for the astute, analytical viewers and another for, well, everyone that likes to be entertained, surprised, and disturbed (including the ones, then, who don't understand it and enjoy it ""in spite of some plot holes"").At a glance, one might dismiss it as a mixture of The Hunger Games and Saw, but it mops the floor with both of those franchises -- in the technical and stylistic departments, as well as in exploring what humans may do at their most desperate (it's also a better social metaphor than The Platform). A varied cast of debt-ridden lowlifes is taken to a secret location (that looks like something out of a Kubrick film), supervised by interchangeable men in masks, to partake in children's games for a reward of 45 billion won. However, should they lose, the penalty is instant death.This becomes very clear very soon, and so the participants are -- get this -- simply given the choice to leave. It's around this point that the series goes from entertaining and original to downright fascinating/thought-provoking. I won't reveal too much, but you can probably guess that the game doesn't end at episode 2 of 9. Subsequent episodes reveal even more about its players; about the desperation inherent to the modern nightmare.The characters are an instantly memorable bunch; horrible in some ways (when at their most desperate), yet ultimately pitiable. We go from loathing the down-on-his-luck Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) to rooting for him and his eventual team; the stone-cold Sae-byeok (Jung Ho-yeon) may be warmer than we suspect, and the dementia-ridden ""Player 1"" (O Yeung-su) harbors strategic insight. There are hidden depths (good and evil) to just about everyone.There is a cleverly constructed twist regarding one particular character. I was able to guess it, pretty much as a joke, but the clues leading up to it made me realize I might not be joking. Squid Game has tremendous rewatch value and this is one of the reasons.Some of what we see does feel a bit superfluous; a few subplots go nowhere and certain character deaths, due to the nature of the game, feel somewhat obvious. That being said, the in-universe game seems highly deliberate -- designed in such a way that only so many players could ever make it to the end -- and some of the deaths in especially the Gganbu episode are among the most heart-wrenching; a simple game of marbles is turned into one of the tensest, most heartbreaking hours of TV/streaming I've seen in years (the games, in general, are a masterclass of set-piece craft). It's not as unpredictable as Game of Thrones (back when it was smart) in terms of just who will perish, but it's hardly contrived that a story focuses on those who made it the furthest. This isn't the same as Plot Armor.My only other big complaint concerns some of the later episodes, where it starts to feel a lot more like a Hunger Games sequel, complete with cartoonish Rich People™ from across the world, including ones who speak American English (as written by someone whose first language is decidedly not English). And yes, I will concede that some plot conveniences/contrivances are exactly that, but they usually serve the show's poetry and dramatic timing.Still, Squid Game is quite the piece of work and I could praise it for far longer than I already have. Its success sets a good precedent. Like Parasite (another far-reaching showcase of South Korean vigor), Squid Game is entertaining and tense enough that general audiences won't be alienated by its morbid strangeness, while being well-written, well-acted, well-scored, visually unique, multilayered, varied, and complex enough to enrich their palette -- whether they watch because it's ""cool"" or not. Still, it's hard to say (especially when a work is this popular) if all these people truly gleaned the show's message.I'm told that some of the in-universe games are being widely mimicked by teenagers on TikTok, and for what it's worth, the mainstream reaction could've been much worse. (My generation isn't much smarter than Zoomers -- think of when we aspired to replicate the catastrophic house party in Project X.) We might see the usual irony of major companies trying to cash in on the popularity of a show with these themes, but what I'm truly spaeing is for Elon Musk or whatever to take a look at this and go ""Squid Game, huh? That sounds pretty neat!"""
50,jakethesnake-42007,Great concept bad acting,7/10,26 September 2021,"I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!

52,AdrenalinDragon,Two thirds great one third Squid drab,8/10,4 October 2021,"Really fun concept of a show that takes time to develop the characters and make you care and understand them before the games begin. Started very strong up until episode 6, then went downhill with all the VIP stuff and plot twists and turns that undermined characters and story stuff earlier on. Has great production values and acting. Episode 6 was the best one by a mile, but the last three episodes were pretty weak overall and makes me a bit worried how Season 2 will turn out.8/10 for Season 1.

54,peeedeee-94281,Squid Pro Quo,4/10,9 October 2021,"There's a lot of hype surrounding this series. I thought it was okay, I almost didn't finish walking it after stopping halfway into episode 1. The problem is that it gets into overly melodramatic family issues, and the protagonist is very unlikable.After fast forwarding to the subway station scene where he meets the guy who eventually gets him into the game, I stuck with the show.So the show is visually interesting. I guess people get intrigued when they see photos of the sets.Unfortunately not all of the games are created equally, and not all of them are based on 'kids games' as we were led to believe (what kid game involves crossing a glass bridge? What kind of kid game involves cutting out a shape out of a cookie?!)
There were quite a few irritating characters. Very stereotypical gangster type. You'd think if the director was clever, he'd have the gangster character redeem himself near the end of his appearance, but no, he goes down still being a jerk.And he is brought down by an equally irritating character, the woman who is introduced as being someone who wanted to leave, but then later turns out to be just as ruthless as the gangster guy.The pakistani guy seems like someone who you can root for, but over time, he does get a bit irritating in his excessive naivety. The old man is also irritating, and honestly, the twist at the end is dumb. But I'll get back to that later.Over the course of the show, you only learn little bits of this place. There are a few foreshadowings that give away twists a bit too easily. You also learn this 'game' has apparently been happening for decades. Strange, nobody seems to notice hundreds of people disappearing at the same time of year? And in all that time, none of the winners ever talked to anyone else about surviving the game?The series has pretty good energy until the last two or three episodes. Then it just loses steam and gets dumb. The introduction of the VIPs completely takes you out of the story. It's so badly handled, you'd think you're watching another show.The final three scene is also inconsistent with the show. Why are they given knives?! I thought the rules were they can't harm each other, because if two of the three were killed, there would be no final game for the VIPs to bet on.The final game is way too predictable, in that, you know it's coming. And it doesn't even play out all that well.After a series of 30 minute episodes, the show ends with a super dull, 50 minute final episode that meanders. You find out about the old man, but you never learn the reasons for the game, other than it's a rich person who is bored. What's dumb is that the old man participated in these dangerous games, and could have died many times. And when we hear him getting shot, how did he NOT get shot? The workers wouldn't know who he was.They never explain who the workers are and why they participate, and how they trust these people won't talk. I guess they stay on the island all year? Or they all go back to their regular jobs.See, so many questions, so many holes. The final ending is also pretty bad. Not sure if they are setting it up for a sequel, or they just wanted a clever, open ending.

55,nidhunmoviebuff,"An ingenious, immensely bingeable thriller series!",8/10,3 October 2021,"Korean content continues to set the standards, this time with a riveting, deliciously dark thriller series on Netflix called Squid Game.Taking inspiration from the simple childhood games played in Korea, a shadowy organization embarks on recruiting out-of-luck people who are burdened by large debts. They then proceed to make these 'contestants' participate in life-or-death versions of these simple games with a large pot of cash as a reward on offer for the final victor.Hwang Dong-hyuk, the genius director behind Silenced (2011) and The Fortress (2017), weaves a rich tapestry of intricate characters ranging from a Machiavellian investment banker to a lazy absentee dad to a North Korean refugee turned pick-pocket.Despite the immense production value and sets, it is these finely written characters that capture your imagination and sucker you into binging the 9-episode thrill ride at a stretch.Lee Jung-jae is electric as the gambling addict who has to embark on the game to cure his mom's illness while O Yeong-su captivates with his nuanced portrayal of an elderly man with seemingly nothing to lose, slowly dying with an ever-growing tumor in his head.Park Hae-soo plays all the layers of his troubled investment banker role with gusto, portraying all the ethical dilemmas and moral turpitude his character faces with conviction. Jung Ho-yeon buys you into the North Korean defector role and the lengths to which she will go to secure the money to enable the rest of her family to cross over to the South.With the storyline pointing clearly towards a Season 2, the director has left enough plot points incomplete to keep the audiences eager for the next instalment of this landmark series.Netflix seemingly has another worldwide sensation on its hands just as Money Heist seems to be drawing to a close.Highly recommended. The perfect weekend binge!"

59,koofasa,Overrated,7/10,4 October 2021,"This was an interesting program but not as great as reviewers are making it sound. This show is about a bunch of deadbeat gamblers who are offered an opportunity to play a game where they either win a lot of money or die a violent death. Only deadbeat gamblers would take the option to play the game knowing only one person will ultimately survive to win the cash. Basically the plot shows how morally bankrupt the world has become and to me that is just sad. It isn't exciting and fun to watch hundreds of people die a bloody death. The fact that so many people found this show to be great is really sad too.

63,FKDZ,"Decent Korean Adventure Drama, emphasis on drama.",7/10,30 September 2021,"I guess I got sucked into the hype around this and was curious about this show, the premise looked fun so I went for it. I finished it in 2 days, which is a testament to the show I guess, but it didn't leave me satisfied.Individually it has some great episodes. But the overall story is weak, and spends too much time with mumbling about irrelevant things. This being most prominent with the whole cop storyline. It's very poorly done and has no payoff whatsoever. It seemed like a excuse just to show some of the workings inside the facility. I wish they cut out the cop plot completely because it was worthless.The directing is good overall, not the greatest but it is a visually appealing show, but this is more so caused by the superb set design. This show definitely has a few ''wow'' moments when shown a new area or room. This also made the next games a lot more interesting and made you curious for how the next game looks.Now the games themselves, the marble game is simply the best because of its drama, and the most striking I think is the first game. Besides that, the other games aren't that great. Mainly due to the poor CGI.Now there is a ton of gore and blood here, and most of it is good. But you can notice when it gets sloppy. The main offenders are the CGI used for people when they fall. It looks very unrealistic and low quality if that makes sense. It's not a convincing effect and a couple of games use that it makes them a lot less fun to watch.The acting was great for the Korean actors. The VIPs are another story, now I wouldn't say their acting was bad. But the dialog that was written was horrible. It felt like a parody of how rich people talk, when that was obviously not intended.The finale, the answers we got were lackluster, there are a couple of plotholes, the reveal was alright though, I liked that. But then... unless the hair change is a symbol for something I don't get it, and the airport scene felt rushed.Overall it's a fun series but don't look to far into it. It's got good fx, nice acting and amazing set pieces, but that's that. (watched in Korean language, not dubbed)"
64,Radu_A,"It's a ""Kaiji"" rip-off alright",7/10,7 October 2021,"While the series deserves its enthusiastic reception for creating a tense atmosphere - although it seriously drops off towards the end, so don't expect too much -, the premise and story heavily borrow from the manga ""Gambling Apocalypse Kaiji"", which has been running from 1996. It's been adapted various times, first as an anime series in 2007. Which is when director Hwang Dong-hyuk admittedly started writing ""Squid Game"".The similarities are too obvious to be ignored: the protagonist is an unemployed compulsive gambler (!) who finds himself whisked off to a ship in the middle of the ocean (!!), where he has to play increasingly daring games against other indebted people (!!!). They build teams to weather competition, and in the end they have to cross a glass bridge (!!!!). Creator Nobuyuki Fukumoto and publisher Kodansha have a strong case for copyright infringement as the credits fail to mention this ""inspiration"".There have also been three movies based on the series (from 2009, 2011 and 2020) which are not very good as the acting leaves much to be desired. ""Squid Game"" definitely satisfies in this department, although it's not a masterpiece like Lee Chang-dong's ""Burning"" (2018) or the Oscar-winning ""Parasite"". But the audacity of this rip-off leaves a sour aftertaste, as it would if Bong Joon-ho would do a superhero movie called ""The Vengeancers""."
65,Mike_T-Little_Mtn_Sound_Archive,Fantastic! But where's the Lee Byung-hun credit on IMDB?,8/10,23 September 2021,"Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the ""walking around"" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited.

66,POIguy,Squid Game . . . TV's next obsession?,9/10,14 October 2021,"When I first heard about Squid Game I thought it was really out there. After watching it, I still have that belief. I like the premise of Squid Game, and I think most of the show is pretty good. The games are fun, you learn to care about the players, and the setting is eerie. I did not really understand the whole organ harvesting side plot, and it seemed unnecessary. The twist at the end was pretty good, but relating everything back to betting on horses was not a good comparison. I'm excited to see if this show will return for another season.

67,howboutthisone_huh,I smell racism,7/10,6 October 2021,"IMO, this is a really well done production. Some aspects get lost in translation (cultural, not language) but it's a well told story, regardless. It's not an original story but a twist on an old classic. What makes it entertaining for western countries like the US is the excellent dubbing. You can't google translate this stuff. It takes someone(s) who understands both the language, the culture, and the pop culture otherwise it's a huge speed bump in the entertainment value. All of the dialog and acting value is in the dubbing, not the writing or the actors themselves. Well, the ones on screen. The dubbing actors did a great job as well as the translators.But, what's glaringly obvious is the racial aspect. That is, throughout most of the story, all of the characters are korean except one who is pakistani. But then we get to the VIPs that everyone is complaining about and all of them are non-korean. In fact, it seems intentionally directed to Gweilos, the slur for white people in asia, and also anything western. A number of people are complaining about the bad acting by the VIPs without realizing that these scenes are probably dubbed too. So the slurs are intentional. Maybe a complicated inside joke by someone(s) making a political or cultural statement.

68,sini-200,"Okay drama, weak ending",6/10,25 September 2021,"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.

69,Nightmarelogic,Dystopian tropes,7/10,3 October 2021,"If you watched any of the most recent dystopian movie likes Hunger Games then you can pretty much figure out that no one is going to win in this. It is made clear that there is only going to be one winner so all the supposed teams are going to end badly so the friendships made are for the sole purpose of making the audience feel something. It kinda does work but it makes you feel manipulated at the same time.This is not a bad show and I can see why people like it. It has all parts to a great Netflix Original but I just felt manipulated while watching it.

71,azanti0029,Battle Royale meets The Hunger Games,8/10,23 September 2021,"An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time."
72,Spartan_1_1_7,An Enthralling Entertaining Experience.,8/10,11 October 2021,"Squid Game is a South Korean series on Netflix that blew up recently and got on my radar. Didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews, all I knew was that it was about some ""Game"" and thought it might be like those Japanese game shows or maybe kinda like Wipeout but with a story. That didn't exactly turn out to be the case and I was hooked quickly during the first episode. The series is about a bunch of people knee-deep in troubles joining a game where they compete for a massive cash prize where the penalty for failure is extreme.Boasting multiple characters that you get to know over the course of the season, all backed up by wonderful performances from the cast, getting invested in the story comes easy. They are a varied bunch and the way the series is directed and paced, you pretty much feel as if you're going through this ordeal alongside them. The psychological manipulation that the organization has set up for them and trying to see what you would have done in the situation only adds to the entertainment.I loved how the creator of the series took mostly common games that a lot of us probably have played sometimes in our childhoods and turned them macabre. With good direction and well-paced flow, the tension was often racked up to a great degree and the more you get attached to certain characters, the more intense it got, sometimes being outright brutal and gut-wrenching (I'm looking at you Episode 6). The games never got boring nor did they get repetitive as there would mostly be some twists and turns added into the mix.It also doesn't hurt the experience that this feels like a big production and not what you'd expect from a ""Game"" series. Apart from a few shoddy CGI shots which can easily be dismissed, most of it looked and sounded great.However, the series does falter a bit in the second half where, for spoilers sake, let's just say some things get revealed and they are what you'd boringly expect and probably have predicted early on. On top of that, the performances in that chunk, especially relative to the performances from the rest of the cast, just weren't good. Would have wished they kept things in the dark more, keep the air of mystery or have a bit more meat. Good thing it doesn't ruin the series nor does it impact the overall story a great deal which does end on a high note with social commentary and messaging that one can enjoy.Overall, props to Hwang Dong-hyuk, the Writer and Director, who after a long journey of being rejected by so many areas finally got to make his series and it's heartwarming to see it get so popular and receive praise and his hard work pay off immensely, so Never Give Up I guess. Unless you're squeamish and can't handle rough stuff, I'd highly recommend this series to everyone, but chances are you have already seen it. Had a great time with it. Wherever they decide to take the story next, I'll certainly am looking forward to it. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it an 8.5/10."

74,fake_moviestar,Watch The Original Korean Dialogue!!,8/10,29 September 2021,"Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?"

There's more story and character development than you might expect from this story and that keeps it from just being generic. As with many shows, the English dubbing is bad: if recommend original Korean with subtitles. One nice thing is that because this is a series and not a movie, they're able to dig into the backstories more and that makes it more engaging and interesting than this may have otherwise been. A great addition to the genre.

I really didn't expect much from this but I was proven wrong really quickly. The basis of this show is something we're all familiar with: wealth inequality and the lines people are forced to and will cross for money, and it was the literal version of 'a rich man's playground'. The poor were just things for him to play with, for some fun and excitement. Anyway, the range of emotions I felt while watching the episodes was enough to leave me somewhat exhausted, but in a good way. Really, I gotta hand it to the team that worked on this because it was clearly a high budget and high quality production. Also, I know it's pretty rare for Korean shows to have more than 1 season, but that ending was hinting at a 2nd season, wasn't it?

Even teens (which are the main target), once the novelty factor fades, will recognize that it's trash.

I was captured right away. The series is filled with twists and turns to keep your head spinning and your mind guessing. Beware, cause there is more than enough violence in the series, and yet there are also many stories of humanity that keep you caring about some of these characters, at the same time that you despise others. Keep an eye out for the many subtle clues that precede future events. You probably won't see them at first, but they are cleverly thrown in often. The best thing about this series is the acting. My mouth fell open at the quality of some of the performances. There are true Emmy or Oscar level performances throughout the show. One of the best series I've watched in a long time.

88,matrixdukenukem,Bring on the darkness,8/10,23 September 2021,"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it."
89,Badr90s,Flawed but Must watch !,8/10,4 October 2021,"This show had the potential to be one of the best foreign mini series ever streamed world wide, maybe it is for some but not for me since the flaws it kept having but covered by the unexpectd shocking events and great actors, the final episode is the reason not to give this show a 9 or 10, the worst plot twist ever happened and ruined it to be a perfect masterpiece, season 2 isn't necessary but seems like it's happening anyway.

The cast bring over-acting to a new level, all the characters are spectacularly annoying (I wanted them all to die by Episode 2) and I don't know why I watched it all. I'm sure there were far better things I could have been doing with my life. Like cleaning my bathroom or cutting my toe nails. It's really woeful.

Idk why its even as popular as it is when there is much better out there. Alice in boarderland is far better and much more intense. You dont know wtf is goin to happen in that show. This show was like escape room meets saw with battle royal but nowhere near as amazing as BR. Skip this or watch if your bored.

92,julieshotmail,"Entertains, educates, as it shocks you along the way",10/10,2 October 2021,"This show's massive popularity, especially among young Netflix viewers, conveniently exposes that audience to the kind of childhood they had all missed out on - playing games outdoors with other neighborhood kids instead of just sitting on the couch watching Netflix. It is pretty clever in that way, yet that is just the beginning, as this show's multi-layered subject matter and plot line are executed so well that ""Squid Game"" guarantees you to be on the edge of your seat. There is plenty of action, suspense, and that occasional gore, but all of those exciting scenes are just a backdrop to the heart-wrenching storyline filled with irony, philosophy, and a message with a punch. ""Squid Game"" is a cinematic experience that stays with you, similar to movies like ""Pulp Fiction,"" and I am glad that it has inched up to the number one spot in Netflix, instead of being lost in the enormous library of mediocre shows that uninspired people watch just to waste time. With ""Squid Game,"" you will not be wasting time. I guarantee it.

By episode 4, I was totally over it.I did watch all 9 episodes, because I'd already invested so much time into it. Plus, I wanted to see what all the social media hype was about...unfortunately, after all 9 episodes, I'm not seeing it.Didn't really need to be 9 hours long...would of worked better as one regular 90-minute film.

The writing does enough to make you care about the characters.The acting was brilliant overall! Camera work, color correction/editing & set design were AMAZING and the music was great.All that said, I don't think it's mind blowing. Parts of the show that others LOUVE you may just like or you won't mind. Don't let that get in the way of your decision to watch the show or not. I think you should not miss out on it. The show is also brutal, dark and might be disturbing but still very entertaining.

97,Aristides-2,Overrated,5/10,7 October 2021,"Among other things, the writer/director stresses several times how the players are 'equal' and must be treated fairly. Then near the end, when the 3 finalists cross the glass bridge successfully, he has the bridge panels explode with great ferocity and causes the young woman to be seriously wounded (and later has her killer explain that it was a mercy killing... that she was terminally wounded. That's hardly fair, don't you agree?The very old man who turns out to be Mr. Big was part of a tug of war game which was not rigged. That means if the winners (unbelievable by the way that they could win against a physically stronger team) lost he would have perished in the fall. Incongruous story mistake.Several semi-finalists, the young woman for instance and one finalist commit suicide, the former unbelievable since she has a mother and brother she wants to save, the latter unexpectedly since he was shown through the competition to do anything to win.I also believe it makes no sense for the VIP's to only show up at the end. Surely the millions of dollars they spend would mean they would want to see every bloody (and I do mean bloody) minute of all the games.I also found making all of the VIP's Americans prejudicial. You mean all the world's class exploitation exists only in the 1 percenters who are American?

Some gratuitous violence over nail-biting twists and turns kept our interest till the end.Each contestants for some reasons had purposes due to rounded character developments.

100,BijeshNagesh,Stellar Storytelling,9/10,8 October 2021,"As survival series go, ""Squid Game"" brought with it something familiar - a game-show setting with a mindblowing cash prize for the winner - and infused it with a ""Hunger Games"", ""Saw"", and other story-telling flavours that felt human in several regards. The show made me genuinely feel for and think about the people involved instead of just watching them go through what they did like an inert spectator.The stakes were high, but so were the perils - especially of the moral kind. The parts where they delved into the Human psyche and captured multiple facets of what different kinds of people are willing to do to win financial freedom... This part, more than anything else, made this Korean survival-thriller series feel at once relatable and well-scripted.The show came close to relying on clichéd tropes and boring plot-elements, but somehow Dong-hyuk Hwang evaded all those loopholes and 'convenience zones'. He also scripted the series, adding to his credence as a visual communicator extraordinaire.Every cast member was excellent, and their performances were on point. Neither one eclipsed the other, in fact each brought something significant to bear on this storyline. The thrills were carried on their performances, and they all did great work.Jaeil Jung's musical scoring more than 'made it work' where this series was concerned. He captured all the right emotions by hitting all the right notes. That ominous choir-orchestra tone he relied on often... That never got old, and routinely perked my sense of suspense.Great work also on set and production design, as well as costumes. These, and other crew departments, including cinematography (strangely unlisted on IMDB), conveyed a sense of complexity and elaborateness by keeping it counter-intuitively simple and theme-centric.A few negatives... There were no cameras in the restrooms. This particular place given its peculiar goings-on should have certainly had them installed there. No cavity checks of the prisoners - that was another 'tricky' omission. The highly trained guards were otherwise not immediately suspicious when one of their own started to act out of protocol. However, these and a handful of other 'loopholes' were needed to progress the plot and did not feel contrived - emphasis on that word, that's where the magic lay in this series.I highly recommend watching all nine episodes in their original Korean-language (non-dubbed) version. Feel free to rely on subtitles to stay informed. That's how I watched ""Squid Game"" on Netflix. The 'feel' was so much different than when I 'tested' a few minutes of the show in its English dub.Being in debt is no joke, it truly destroys lives and families, even entire friendships and romances. This series captured the sheer helplessness of being in debt, and it did so through its characters. It also captured the depths of human depravity, and what some people with too much money are willing to do.With Netflix's ""Squid Game"" Dong-hyuk Hwang has made a 'dark' mark one won't soon forget. He proved how artfully you can take a cliché, or something familiar, and twist it into something new. ""Squid Game"" had that in abundance, and made me feel like I was watching something genuinely artistic and soulful. The show went deep into the primal nature of Humankind instead of just showcasing our 'better nature'.

101,The_Swedish_Reviewer,A slowly told Survival Game series,7/10,19 September 2021,"I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.

102,nagsaptarshi,Squid Game- Another Korean Gem,10/10,6 October 2021,"I am an ardent follower of the Korean movies. Even though most of the movies are laden with violence, gore and bloodbath, the chills and thrills of most of the movies I have watched till date have not disappointed me. But I was a bit apprehensive of watching a Korean web-series even though it is insanely popular and one of the most trending shows in the recent past. The very name Squid Game , the latest offering from Netflix did not appear to be very much appealing. However, I risked my time on the rave reviews the show is getting. And boy! It has paid back. I cannot recall any single show more edge of the seat than this. Yes, there may be better shows in terms of intrinsic production values. But if you ask me to select one show where even for one second, I could not hold my breath, it was this, it was this, nothing but this. Normally my hectic work schedule does not allow me to binge-watch a show. But Squid Game eventually turned me to a Binge-watcher. It is so much enjoyable, spine chilling and mind bending.It is believed that even if ghosts exist, the human beings are capable of making this world even a more ghostly place than the original ghosts would do. Basically, greed, lust, lack of control, survival instinct, desire for power and authority, insanity make people do macabre things and when people get the taste of blood, they become even more dangerous than the man-eating animals. Squid Game captivates human emotions to an extent you are awestruck. The level where people can stoop to, to make things shinier for his own life will make you sick as you watch episodes after episodes of this brilliantly made series. The raw violence and gore trademarks of the Korean style of moviemaking is present throughout and this makes the show unsuitable for the children even though the central theme is based on the games played during childhood. In the age of Super Computers, when people have stopped playing those forgotten games any longer, a group of losers are seduced to play six rounds of those games. Winning will guarantee them freedom from every debt as the rewards of winning are astronomical. But the punishment for losing is what makes the series so very horrific, gruesome and rewarding- death. How the real-life losers vie with each other to redeem their own lost hopes is the plot of this super paced series.The show is full of metaphors. It may be worth mentioning that of late numerous movies have also come up with the portrayal of the absence of an egalitarian society in South Korea. The rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer. Remember Parasite and the subtle show of class struggle therein? Squid Game also tends to point fingers to the inequality prevailing in the South Korean society. Few references to the illegal immigration from North Korea are there, too.Squid Game in may ways is similar to one movie I watched long back- Exam. There also the creator worked on the same concept and I liked that movie. But in Squid Game, the dividends are more rewarding, scintillating and thrilling. I simply cannot recall a single dull moment in the entire show with a runtime of around eight and half hours. The lead actors especially Lee Jung-jae, Park Hae Soo, Jung Ho-yeon are stunning. The old man (I could not google his name) was fascinating. The script is tight, gripping and addictive. The cinematography is insanely horrific just what the screenplay demanded. The music matches with the spirit of the show. The creator Hwang Dong-hyuk creates an environment that is claustrophobic, ominous and jaw dropping.Overall, this show will haunt you days after you have finished watching it. Remember, it is not an easy watch because of the abundance blood spill. But if you are a lover of the thriller/horror genre, this is a series you have been waiting for years. This is going to make amends for the poor choices Netflix has been making for sometime now. Be a player, watch Squid Game.My Rating - 9.5 out of 10."

105,DaegT,Squid Game vs Alice in Borderland,6/10,25 September 2021,"Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!

106,jsucie,Fun and surprisingly emotional,8/10,4 October 2021,"The was a fun, fascinating show that was more emotional than I ever expected it to be but also not as violent as I was expecting either. There is some brutal violence but extremely tolerable unless you are squeamish.Many of the characters you will feel a connection to even if they aren't in the main cast. There are some you will enjoy getting their ""come up'ins"" to a satisfying end. The choices the lead characters make will enrage you and make you despise them but the backstory given to those characters will also make you understand why they do/did the things they do/did.There isn't much in the way of surprises (except the hair, if you've finished you know what I mean) but there are some decent plot twists that may catch you off guard.

This is worth the watch and dubbing in English didn't look or sound as bad as it could have."

108,francoischristana,Must watch!!!,10/10,9 October 2021,"Wow this show had me on an emotional roller coaster. It really makes you wonder could you really be that cold if you were in the same predicament. I became invested in the main characters background stories and rooted for them throughout the entire competition. The most heartbreaking scene was when Ali died he was very kind-hearted and the game was too cut throat. I can't believe the old man was the chairman behind this operation.

109,cyifly-2,Modern Day Twilight Zone,9/10,8 October 2021,"Very well done production. It was like a modern day Twilight Zone. Character development was excellent, music/score was spot on and like another important character, and story was well done. It was creepy, chilling, bloody, touching, and emotional. It had a little bit of everything.The very few complaints about it I do have don't outweigh the good points - The acting was a little over-done at times. The voices and lines of the VIPs were way over-acted, the subtitles were very fast and hard to keep up with at times, and the last episode/ ending was just a little too bizarre - it took away from the good parts of the earlier episodes.But definitely watch it.

111,catdogmanfish,It's okay,6/10,8 October 2021,"This is a simple formula that has been done to death ""poor people being made to do highly fatal games while rich people watch"". By now people should be over this kind of thing, but it makes them feel smart, and they can parrot phrases they heard from other people like ""it's an study of human nature"" etc etc. The positives for it are the aesthetic of the sets and costumes. This world and it's environment just make you want to jump into the screen and explore, though not if it means being a part of the games. I enjoyed it well enough but let's face it, this is no 8.0+ IMDB ratings are a joke.

112,tariqzafar-12020,Good series but not upto the hype,8/10,3 October 2021,"I started watching this series having heard that it is one of the most successful Netflix series ever produced. It was definitely a great series. The treatment, social message etc were great. Kinda reminded me of a movie I watched called Platform. But i would stop short of calling it the best. The concept might have been given a bit different treatment but at the end it was still akin to an escape room. The scenario under which the participants come back also sounds far fetched. Ok there could be a lot of difficulties and hardships in the outside world but would someone want to go back to a place risking their lives where they are 99% sure to die. But the show depicts that the people once left the show first time they were so desperate for money that they came back irrespective of the dangers there. Not so believable according to me. The reasoning of the old man why he conducted this game was also kind of ridiculous. But all fine in the name of fiction. Loved the characters otherwise.

113,A_Llama_Drama,Big budget window dressing,2/10,26 September 2021,"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.

114,ianwagnerwatches,Hollow Pop Art,5/10,26 September 2021,"*light spoilers of plot details*So, Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize, at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? However, this story paints the loves of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice what should be an international headline (except for one detective who decides to investigate it off the books, who conveniently informs noone of his investigation or wherabouts.As well, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: that all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them, and all participants are made aware of this fact, and despite that meaning that they and the people they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival. And yet, all of them act as if it isn't the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 225 people killed before their very eyes decided that their problems weren't bad enough to warrant throwing their lives away in a game that only one person could survive. Bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everybody who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they in fact had no reason to live or were going to die anyway, and that the only way normal life would be feasible is if they give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor; but, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer like myself to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole they could go. By the way, the last episode is damn near impossible to sit through and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.

115,alexscott-35299,Brilliant television!,8/10,6 October 2021,"This show has some serious hype at the moment so I thought why not give it a go. This series is such an interesting concept, it's like a blend of hunger games and saw with some real life elements thrown in as well as some interesting Asian quirks. The way the show is set up just keeps you asking questions, the whole show is just a lot of questions really and it's great as it keeps your mind racing. Once I'd started this series I couldn't stop as I just needed to know what was happening next! This show just keeps you hooked and I love it. It's pretty emotional at times also, I didn't think I'd be so emotionally attached to these characters but by the end I was so engrossed and found myself really sad as certain characters were eliminated from the games. Honestly believe the hype that this show has and give it a watch!

116,bluefim,Far from a masterpiece but good enough,5/10,6 October 2021,"Let me preface: no, I am not a random person coming just to complain about something popular like the argument a lot of fans of this show make to defend it. I have seen many horror/thrillers including the death game genre, so while I thought it had a mix of fun moments and boring ones, I can't wrap my head around the hype. Many people bring up how it is similar to X game, book, movie, etc. So I'm thinking Netflix created a way for casual and non-horror viewers to get exposure to it thinking it's new or innovating.Complaints about that aside, the first and sixth episodes are the best and the second is the worst by far with other ones somewhere between, so really the entire show was like a rollercoaster entertainment-wise for me. It is watchable for sure, but certain characters (mainly the cop) are so moronic but protected by plot and could have been done away with or re-written. Also annoying is, yes, the VIPs act horribly and, yes, everyone keeps ignoring the point of the game being there's only one winner.In summary, was it good? Depends on personal taste. Was it genius, unique, or without flaws? Absolutely not. I didn't enjoy it enough to binge, but it made for a decent casual viewing. I'd suggest trying it yourself and forming your own opinions about it rather than listening to others about how amazing or terrible it may be."
117,benxrichardson,It's a masterpiece,9/10,13 October 2021,"Every aspect of Squid Game is done almost to perfection. The character development is perfect and draws you into the contestants lives. You end up genuinely caring about many of them.The show is vibrant and fresh with dark undertones leaving you feeling unsettled throughout.The ending seems slightly forced but not enough to diminish this exceptional piece of work.

119,acdc_mp3,An onion of a show. One layer reveals a disturbing fact.,10/10,13 October 2021,"Just completed the series and found this show so thought provoking for many reasons. You have your standard character developmental checklist which is desperation, greed, boredom, curiosity, evilness and pure disregard that builds a cast of characters. The premise of the show is simple on the surface, but it much more complex the deeper you get into it.This show also brings a disturbing realization to me in real life:
I mentioned the show to my daughter who is in her first year of teaching kindergarten. She said 3/4 of her students are watching the show! That shocks me but it also explains why the children today in public school are malcontents. What I hear from my daughter, wife (who is also a teacher) and many other teachers is school is more of place to dump misfit children that gets absolutely no life lessons from their parents. The fact that 3/4 of her students know and watch Squid Game tells me everything I need to know where our society is going. It's not pretty, and Squid Game has a very strong potential of becoming reality. 3/4 of our little darlings are going to find themselves in debt, in trouble, in a desperate need that they would step on their mother's throat to get out of. What a warm and fuzzy thought!"
120,shahrad,Child's Play,7/10,7 October 2021,"Cube, Escape Room, The Cabin in the Woods, The Hunger Games....etc! Seems that mortal combats for the pleasure of elites has become very popular lately.Well, to be honest, it could have been so much better if it was made in America. A great plot though, some great lines(as well as cheesy ones) and twists but still lacks something in between. Sometimes it falls so deeply into its childish play you may wonder if the show has been made for juniors.Final thought: a very entertaining miniseries that I wished was made in Hollywood! End of story!

124,rchosen-193-5535,Kind of overrated.,6/10,1 October 2021,"One problem I am finding is with more asian made entertainment, now they get higher ratings by other asians simply because it's asian made. Kind of defeats the purpose of users rating things if they will rate something higher if its from their country/their culture.I watched Squid Game with my wife (asian mind you) and while it was interesting, I didn't love it like some are. It's yet another battle royale movie, just in a different style. It's not horrible mind you, just nothing mind blowing. Watch it once and will never watch it again kind of thing.This all said I also gave it a lower score for subtitles and English audio. We watch things in whatever native language something is in and will read the subtitles. But for starters there were many mistakes in the subtitles which change the context of certain scenes. So unless you know Korean, you are likely getting a out of context version through the subs.And if you watch in English audio (I watched some of it out of curiosity)..... it is AWFUL. Not only is half of what they are saying wrong, but there is almost no emotion in the dubbers voices. I know some don't like having to constantly look down to read subtitles, but trust me, the regular Korean track gives you WAY more emotion."
125,maakus,Definitely not deserving of the high rating.,5/10,1 October 2021,"First off: the idea with child games contests leading to death has been done before in Takashi Miikes ""Kamisama no iu tôri."" It almost feel a bit shameful how they just lifted that idea from that movie and especially from a so known director.Second: I mostly have experience with South Korean horror movies and i've always thought that South Korean acting was more realistic and western compared to the more theatrical overacted Japanese and Chinese, but the acting in Squid Game definitely feels more theatrical, which is not a good thing imo. It's hard to connect with the story and the actors when they're expressing every emotion with shouting, flailing their arms and making exaggerated faces. This might be a cultural thing and obviously people like that kind of acting in Asia, but i prefer the realistic kind.Third: The VIPs... Listen, South Korean movie makers: Stay away from ""actors"" from the West who moves to SK to try their luck because they were unemployable on the Western market. They were horrible. Just terrible.Finally: Squid Game could've been compressed to three hours and still lend lots of time for character development, interactions, the games, the B plot and everything else. This series was way way WAY too drawn out and got constantly stuck in all these overacted scenes with drawn out emotions. The games wasn't fun (and we've seen it before) and once again; got stuck, drawn out and boring."
126,Scar38,Ok....ish.,6/10,6 October 2021,"I was blown away when I first started watching this, but as the series went on it got a bit tedious, and some of the acting was terrible, especially from the woman who had the lighter, she almost made me want to abandon the whole series.There is some good acting though, and the idea of the series is very good and interesting.I'd like this to be re-made by the Americans, I think it would definitely be interesting.

128,Healing_Process,Another interesting story that I knew would crawl into the potent trope and hardcore stereotype Asian show.,5/10,25 September 2021,"The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.

129,kleinjoshua-76516,"Great watch, with only a few not great",7/10,6 October 2021,"Overall I love the show. Great story, of the games. Few things I don't like....the acting is sub par and feels scripted. And the main character, you wanna like the main character. And I don't, he's a sleazy Grambling addict who is really a piece of garbage. I dont care whether he makes it or not. And overall this show makes Koreans seem....cringy. Horrible people.

130,blackoutH,"Aiming high, falling short",7/10,10 October 2021,"First of, I am glad to see this is an ongoing trend, non-English movies making their way to become global phenomenon reaching a wider audience, which allows us to get fresh perspectives on reality from different nations around the world.The concept of Squid Game in itself is nothing new, a bunch of unsuspecting individuals getting caught up in a game which they quickly learn might have some severe consequences; on the other hand, the way the concept is explored does bring some fresh perspectives.The main character is easily relatable, and as we understand the struggles he had to go through he becomes an instant character success; another positive aspect of the show is the stunning set and production design, you can see a lot of work was put into it, almost no VFX are used and the sets were actually built.It starts strong, you get attachment to the characters, most of them do a really great job on the acting skills, even though from time to time there's some weird overacting going on, which is hard to distinct if it has any hidden meaning behind and even with the slow episodes you will be interested to see how the story unfolds.As we get to the finale however that's a different story, not only it's an anti climatic slow episode, but also seems to decide to go for a direction which doesn't make much sense based on the previous events..Without giving any spoilers, the main twist it's not only a bit predictable but also ruins one of the previous and most emotional episode of the show.Also the main character decision in the last minutes also seems to be completely irrational and not at all inline with his core motivations, the whole point of him joining the game is thrown out the windows in a matter of seconds.Still I did enjoy it for the most part, I don't think it's overhyped, they could've made some better decisions with the ending but then again this is always an inglorious task no matter which series you make, worth the watch regardless."
131,boboceaelena,Gruesome sometimes but also emotional,9/10,29 September 2021,"After ""Liar Game"" and ""Alice in Borderland"" we have ""Squid game"".Some parts have been gruesome and to much fo me but thank God it's on Netflix and I could skip :).Marbles game was so emotional that I have cried a little and I'm not ashamed to admit it.Very happy to have binge watch it.PS. Gong Yoo from ""Train to Busan"" or Goblin has also a short appearance among many other known actors from K-dramas.

The cinematography is great and can be very clever at times, the acting and direction is on point too.Definitely recommend, if you like a horror/thriller Squid Game is a series that will have you hooked right from the off.

135,jon-22643,"The acting is fabulous, hard to find such level nowadays",9/10,2 October 2021,"Outstanding acting performance by ALL actors, so it looks realistic despite of the imaginary plot. People who hit rock bottom and have nothing to lose or that simply have no other choice take the very high risk of death hoping to win a kids game that will solve all their problems for good, or so they think. The only problem is that those who lose the game are killed immediately, so it's actually a game of life and death. Makes you think about the horrible life of the poor, who suffers with no future, while the wealthy enjoy.

What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it.

Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers.

141,lynansaysingle,Kid's Games into Survival Game,9/10,8 October 2021,"I have been very greatly entertained by this series. I would have given it a 10 but I took a point off because of the poor acting from the VIP's and the ending that seemed rushed. I could have thought of a better suited and deserving ending instead of a destructive one. I also did not understand the drastic change of hair color in the end. The subtitles can also be improved. Accurate translations including the slangs can change the effect of any foreign film.All in all, this series is fantastic! It has interesting twists and surprises. It is violent so I definitely do not recommend for kids to watch even though it has kids games in it. The story reminded me of The Hunger Games but also unique in its own way. I would classify this as Horror/Drama/Thriller genre. The character development is very well written where a lot of movies fail to succeed. It is very important to any movie. Episode 7 for me is quite emotional and also 9. You have to be cold hearted not to fight back the emotions of what this episode brings. All the main characters did a great job. I like the mixture of different types of people. Definitely recommend.

There is a very linear story line, people in a lot of debt get invited to play some very basic games. Twist is, they get killed if they don't win. That's it. There is some initial shock during the first game, but that wanes as the series progresses. There are a some semi-interesting, but predictable back stories, and most of the characters have few, if any redeeming features, so you don't really care who survives. It is easy to be seduced by the initial shock of the first reveal, but it really doesn't progress much from there. I'd recommend. Midnight Mass on Netflix if you want some real horror.

Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.

145,anikb-87099,Near to Masterpiece!,10/10,19 September 2021,"You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...""Can money buy you happiness?"". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long)."
146,dannylee-78082,A Decent Weekend Watch,7/10,23 September 2021,"What I liked about itVery addicting for most of the series. Couldn't let go of it.Except for a couple actors, I thought the overall acting was pretty good. MINYU was particularly noticeable - super obnoxious character.Plus points for pulling off a genre that wasn't attempted in K-dramas before.The set and the overall color of the series. Very vibrant color in contrast to the rather grotesque story the series portrayed. Loved that.Decent ending for the games. Was an unexpected ethos of arriving to a rather predictable conclusion.Just the right amount of gore for my taste.----What I didn't like about itVIPs were so cringe. I suppose it's hard to find decent English speaking non Korean actors in Korea. They were truly atrocious.Unclear messaging. Maybe not unclear - just a bit messy job conveying the message.Ep 8-9 were a little dragged on - could have had faster pace.The cop storyline was a little off-putting. Wish we saw more depth and development in there."
147,riteshshergill,An absolutely riveting show but a difficult one to watch,10/10,21 September 2021,"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions."

The only white people in this whole series are cast as the irredeemable bad guys. I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

153,redkyng,Being a human....!?,8/10,10 October 2021,"It's more than just a show or very strange idea from South Korea's minds, slowly with the characters development there will be a lot of questions about life in general and especially about being a human or not... and this is the strength of the show, yes as lot of viewers I didn't like that much the last 3 episodes mainly because of the introduction of some strangers...... otherwise it is a solid show.

A must watch,9/10,2 October 2021,"I am the first to admit I'm a lazy movie watcher and am not big on dubbing foreign movies or subtitles so when I kept hearing about Squid Game I was hesitant.This movie was amazing and was such a well written and interesting story.I've seen others bag the VIPs and I agree that was the weakest point of the show but hard to fault anything else.Can't wait for season 2.

159,WhimsicalMusings,YIKES! Okay.....,8/10,15 October 2021,"Do you still believe humans are good?SG had me yelling at the screen like I was back at Chestnut Street in Philly.It wasn't necessarily that all the players are horror-movie-stupid, but rather, many didn't catch on quickly enough to how ruthless the game was becoming. I tried to plead with them: Open your eyes! Wake up! Dig up your inner skeptic!!! Work on the world ""NO!"" Augh!Hwang Dong-hyuk, the author stated his purpose: ""I wanted to write a story that was an allegory or fable about modern capitalist society, something that depicts an extreme competition, somewhat like the extreme competition of life."" He was building on his own experience of financial hardship.SG is another foray into the callus debauchery of which humans are capable. SG builds on 'The Most Dangerous Game' with a twist. Here, bored wealthy men devise a game in which they entice poor souls who are in financial straits to come play. What the people aren't told is that it's a game to the death, and out of 456 players, only one will remain alive at the end. Instead of the wealthy participating in the hunt, they prefer to watch the ""horses"" perform... And die.K-dramas excel at extracting every possible wince and gasp out of the viewer. The horror, the absolute sickness of using the happy color pink, along with other nursery colors, and the giant doll, is all nauseating. It multiplies the dread.The story of the cop, Hwang Jin-ho, is heartbreaking. He only went there to save his brother, and his brother ended up killing him. His brother had been seduced by the power of the dark side. Lee Byung-hun, who played the front man & cop's brother, expertly displayed suppressed grief, & overt resolve to continue forward. After all, it's his brother, or him, right?Every performing ""horse"" has a number. Numerology sites offer mostly identical interpretations. This is not meant to be an endorsement, it is to decode what the writer is telling us. Definitions in Numerology tend to be general, which broadens the applications. Having said that, Let's see if any of the numbers have any special significance...>456 is slacker-protagonist Seong Gi-hun, and signifies effort and patience. A mentor is needed who will teach how to learn to work harder on oneself before other things. Hard work will add value to life. 456 picked up a gganbu mentor in 001. Who says the mentor has to be a good person?>218 is for Cho Sang-woo, 456's friend from the 'hood,' who became a whilte collar hood as an adult. He mirrors the old man to a point. He failed in his ruthless journey to gain wealth, but found redemption in his last moments.The number 218 symbolizes manifesting one's biggest and seemingly impossible desires into reality, often related to: wealth, business, duality, realism, karma, & serving humanity. He knows that 456 will serve his mother, as well as humanity with the money. This loathsome human craved redemption at the end of his life, and he received it.>067 is for Kang Sae-byeok, the North Korean defector, who wants to protect her family. No surprise, 067 signifies home, family, unconditional love, providing, responsibility, sacrifice, & service to others. Creating a solid foundation for the future, and protecting their families & possessions is the priority of 067's.>001, the old man's # is at its most positive when in the realm of work. It is a number given to winners to indicate the first place. This number represents independence, but this can also mean loneliness, isolation, or being single.>101 is gangster, Jang Deok-su's number. It's primary function is romance, followed by the importance of relationships. At first blush this doesn't fit with the character, though he did get involved in a quasi romantic relationship. Let's flesh this out further.It's basic function is coexistence. Without it, a 101 is alone, which doesn't exist in the 101 essence. People with that number can feel lonely and lost whenever they think of themselves as being alone. #101 must have grown up in an environment that failed to provide his basic needs, leaving him consumed with bitterness.The number also points to eternity & the journey, with all its uncertainties, that is about to begin. 101 is a reminder that we are not in control of our destiny but that God is in control. 101's should follow the path set and learn all possible before the time on this plane is completed. It's sad to think that 101 obviously didn't get emotional support or the tools to succeed in life. He is still responsible for his infractions, but it's sad, nevertheless.>199 is Abdul Ali, one of the worst heartbreaks of the show. 199's are independent & comfortable pursuing their agenda, which, for Ali is providing for his family on his own. #199's goals virtually never conflict with long-term human survival and well-being. We see that Ali is good, and decent, albeit naive. He's also foolish to be so independent that he wagered his life in that way to provide for his family.>212 is for Han Mi-nyeo, the crazy acting women who killed #101.#212 is for a person who frequently follows newly-acquired interests, perhaps on a whim - meeting new people, and visiting unfamiliar places. 212 is about curiosity & adventure & tends to be a good team member. The energy can be sensual. A caution is to not to go overboard with actions they may lead to negative outcomes. Enroute towards goals, 212's might face harsh challenges.An additional connection to 101 is that only the negative interpretations are exhibited by them. Their harsh lives had severed them from the positive elements olin themselves. They portray ruthlessness, but there is a sadness, or a sense of loss about them too.>111 is the doctor. A 111 won't let himself be slotted into a team member role, unless the role is real leadership, not a role where he's told how to lead. If 111's thoughts are negative, it could be attract toxic situations and people into life.>240 is Ji-yeong, who was just released from prison after killing her abusive father. She sacrificed her life for 067, as thus negated the lie the VIP's tell themselves. She had already sacrificed her freedom to administer justice for her mother.#240 is about nurture & mutual support with a high focus on security for the future, provided without prompting or expectation of return.>244, the pastor: Spiritual advancement is something that can be phenomenal in a 244's life. He must keep wrong at bay and not offend the inner energy that his maker installed. Do not lose hope that belief will provide the reasons to continue.>the husband/wife duo is represented in 69, or two identical digits facing and complimenting each other to make a whole. If we squeeze 6&9 together we could make an 8, or the eternity sign. In addition, the visual aspect of the # is sometimes seen as a symbol of yin and yang.The energy of 69 is best when involved directly with family or team as an equal, provided 69's vision or ideal is present or promising.Freakily, #069 symbolizes the closure of a chapter in life & encourages one to be prepared for a rather traumatic phase. Whether the ending is good or bad, it is bound to bring a huge change in life. Be prepared for it because the the manner in which it's dealt with is going to effect the rest of one's life.Upon their return, in EP3, 187 players return. It's the US police code for murder.Getting chills?Contrast to these poor rich people. Their lives are so empteeeeee. Sigh.Up to 21% off CEO's are psychopaths. It's not a stretch to guess that some of these rich degenerates are in that club. They also exhibit heightened sadism. These reprobates can't seem to notice through all the haze of life, that people are most gratified when we help others.001 didn't get what he wanted by hosting Squid Game, which was friendship through comraderie as well as a cure for boredom. It seems he and the VIP's justified their actions by deluding themselves that they were conducting a social experiment- The fact that they pit people against each other, and reassure themselves that everyone is as cutthroat as them, allowed them to inveigle their own selves that those people deserve to die: Look at who they really are! In the end, the old man had the whole world, but was utterly unsatisfied.The old man craved the friendship he'd had when he was poor. He felt that kinship with 456, even though 456 eventually betrayed him. (At the time, 456 had a second chance, too. He could have done the all-or-nothing but refused. That was his worst moment). What 001 had seen, over the many years, allowed him to forgive 456 due to the kindness 456 had shown overall. He meant it when he called 456 his gganbu, or close buddy.This kinship manifests itself in that the old man wanted to see HIM at the end of his life. 456 is there at his bedside when he died. Where's his wife? Where's his kids?? Where's his grandkids??? Just 456 and a paid aid were there. The old man saved 456's 'life' a second time, by jolting him back to living.456 is who he is. Even when he wins he's a pathetic winner that barely stumbles across the line. He won, but he didn't get what he wanted. When he went to see the old man in the penthouse, he won their game, but he didn't get what he wanted: The old man died before 456 could kill him. However, it did wake 456 up. He no longer had to feel guilty about tricking & almost killing the old man. He now feels badly about not completing the task.The red hair indicates that he's now either on fire or starting to blaze his trail. Finally.This is not over. We need a season 2. The question has not been answered yet.Quote:

161,shoppsi,This is a review of the first episode only...,3/10,13 October 2021,"...and I couldn't even finish it.Maybe it gets good; I don't know, as it has so much hype and good reviews.I just know it's not for me.The main character is so unlikeable that I don't care what happens to him. Maybe he grows as a character...he probably does, but I don't care enough to stick around to see.The acting is over the top. The main character pulls faces every two minutes. I've seen better acting in high school plays, but maybe a lot is missing in the translation.If I ever watch the rest I'll come back and write a better review but for now, this is a hard pass."
162,xetaprime-64257,"First Few Episodes a 10, Then...",7/10,27 September 2021,"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.

164,Arik_P,Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?Good?bad?,4/10,30 September 2021,"Answer: Do not know. Binged through the 9 episodes .Mixed feelings mixed opinions , mixed reactions,
Excessively brutal and violent yet all the brutality and violence hides a hidden agenda for everyone to interpret as he/she wishes. As I watched the English dubbed version with Hebrew subtitles I can only say that the subtitles often differed from the dubbed English ,hence i believe that the translated subtitles are more close to the original Korean version that the dubbing. The main character actors give a reasonable performance while some others should keep their day jobs.So is it worth watching?-See the Subject line. I would rate it 0/10 and 8/10 at the same time. Hence I am giving it a 4.

Its starts very good, the first 3 parts are very enjoyable, but then it goes down quite quickly. Everything is far too obvious, from the beginning everything is so clear, not one single surprise to the end, and as a big fan of korean cinema i was disappointed by the poor storyline, the bad dialogues and the overacting. Furthermore full of plotholes, another user already mentioned step by step the stupidities and logical mistakes. All in all nothing special.

166,deothor,It was both exhausting and entertaining,6/10,13 October 2021,"My biggest problems was how main character has been portrayed. He was detestable. First 10 minutes of the show and I really, really, really wanted to punch the guy in the face and turn off the show.The show kinda uses dirty trick to make him less what he was portrayed as and more relatable. This effect was the strongest on 6th episode, Gganbu, which was also the best one out of all 9.In all honesty i had to force myself to watch first 3 episodes and they totally failed to hook me in. I only kept on watching because otherwise i'd feel like I wasted 3 hours for nothing. Sunk cost fallacy.I am kind of glad that I did. Kind of.At episode 5 things got slightly better. 6th was the best, the peak of the show and after that it was slow and weird fall. Yeah, episode 7, 8 and 9 were weird to say the least.The issues: The playgrounds and props look cheap. Director tried to imitate 'hunger games'... things (episode 7 onwards) but... boy, oh boy.. It's just bad. Fake blood was downright insulting.. While some scenes were brutally real. Like DUDE, decide. Want me to be grossed out with fake CGI blood stain, or puke my guts out?!The games are weird and some of them make little sense difficulty-wise, while others are made so unfair I just scratch my head ""what was the point other than playing SAW movie on us?"". Seriously some of those games a blender with nails and glass would be safer place than whatever they came up with.Ending, without any spoilers... Here's the thing: Koreans to my knowledge LOVE unhappy/sad endings. It seems they just need to be beaten down emotionally. I seriously do not remember the last Korean movie that didn't end up sad for the sake of sad. And because it's a 9-episode long show, the ""sad ending"" phase is stretched quite a bit. Not gonna lie, I did feel like my eyes got teary, but it was annoying, rather than earned.Should you watch it... Did you like saw (and/or dont mind gore)? If so, go ahead. Do you have netflix? If so... eh, sure.I wish i could just tell you to watch episode 6.. but without knowing the characters and their relationship... Eh it's either all or none case, sadly. I will definitely not bother with season 2 if we ever gonna get one."
167,phebychow,Must watch!,9/10,3 October 2021,"It becomes one of successfully Korean dramas. Besides the brutal element, the setting of each game involves lot of tactics, eg composition of the team, your partner, sequence etc.. which determine your success rate. There is nothing relevant to distasteful Saw game! Plus all of them participate in the game on a voluntary basis!Another thing I like most is about character development. All main characters' acting are excellent, and the supporting roles like snake tattoo, Pakistan contestants are also competent. It reminds me of Busanhaeng! However, these foreigners VIP acting are so embarrassing.Just a bit strange. Gi-Hoon personality setting difference before and after participating in the game is too much. In the past, he was kind of greedy gambler. However he suddenly ends up like a superhero with full of truth and justice. If you don't want to use the money, it's better to donate it. So comparatively Sang-Woo character is more consistent. All in all, I did enjoy it from the beginning till the end."
168,gnatsong,There Are some wonderful Korean series.,2/10,8 October 2021,"This isnt one of them. There were some great characters, but sadly, they were wiped out til only the dregs remained. They dregs weren't much better than the English speaking vips that had to be the most poorly cast actors in the history of the universe. The end was fitting. Bleak. The movie was bleak. Bleak can be good, but there needs to be a point. There wasn't one here. I cared not a lick about those that remained. This was a terrible waste.

Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel ""truth"" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan.

170,scarlettimogen,Something different for a change,10/10,3 October 2021,"Great show. Brilliant acting. Apart from the VIPs who thankfully had a small part otherwise they could have overshadowed a fantastic show. The bureaus are great screenwriters and I hope this introduces people to the brilliance of Korean filmmaking (start with Train to Busan!)

171,SofiCastle,This is really worth it,8/10,2 October 2021,"If you are wondering if this show is worth of all the hype, it is.Just a few flaws for me: the cop sub plot feels silly; and as usually in korean dramas, when they need white characters (the VIPs here - by the way, could you imagine a US show were all the villains would be POC?) they cast the same bunch of untalented dudes. Their acting is so bad that i really wonder if they are truly actors or if there are just white dudes livng in Korea.

176,yeolit,Shallow plot seemingly mimicked from other series,3/10,24 September 2021,"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot."
177,jon_hsieh,"Great start, bad finish.",6/10,27 September 2021,"The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.

179,tifa4evr,Fantastic story and brilliant direction with only one tiny problem...,8/10,12 October 2021,"I have no complaints about the story of Squid Game or the violence and gore in the story, it's actually done rather tactfully throughout, showing just enough here and there to make it worthwhile and fun to watch.The acting is top form in all respects, every portrayal is perfect and heart-wrenching in places in both how perfectly its shown and how decent it's made .Even the sets are painstakingly jarring and off-putting, that. ""relativity"" style primary colour hallway set is so jarringly off-putting and decently alluring at the same time, I knew on first seeing it that I'd love the set decoration and propworks.So why after all this gushing for how wonderfully amazing this is am I not giving it a 10/10?Because I want this series to be literally just this, a 9 episode story of a down-on-his-luck man with decent ambitions who goes through hell only to come out on the other side as a hero.But that ending man, that ending...the sequel bait in it is thick as 10 week in the snow syrup. And I don't want that, I don't want Gi-hun to become some warrior trying to take down the international Squid Game people. Let this be the amazing single season it is that shows even the lowest man can become something amazing when given the chance.

180,mosquitocyn,Dark and disturbing interesting watch,8/10,6 October 2021,"It's a watchable series but not something that will make me watch a season 2. The cast is great, acting is good (except for the English speaking VIPs wearing masks). The personal stories of the contestants and how they interact between each other make the series more human than just a survival game. It does get bloody and somewhat violent as most survival game films do. So, one season is good enough for me.

183,ThatAnimeSnob,A dumb variant of death games,5/10,7 October 2021,"This show got a lot of buzz when it came out and after a lot of people pressuring me to tell them what I think about it, I did so. It isn't very long and it manages to keep you wanting to see what comes next, so in case you are looking for something thrilling you can marathon in a single day it's a good choice. That's what I did and I had a lot of fun with how stupid it was. Sure, it's a death game type of show, which means you are watching it for the spectacle of people dying by the hundreds over petty reasons. This doesn't mean they don't need to have a decent plot you can follow without eyerolling all the time. I don't expect a good reason for why the police don't get suspicious when hundreds of people disappear at once or the banks don't care when a poor man's account all of a sudden has a ridiculous amount of money. It is the structure of the games that make you dumber the more you think about it.For starters what kind of a game doesn't let you know the rules and the penalties before beginning to play, so you will know what is at stake? Half of the players got killed in the first game alone because they panicked when they saw they kill you when you lose. This wouldn't have happened if they were told elimination means death. It doesn't matter if we the audience knew it was. The characters in game didn't. When you see people getting shot to death right next to you and you weren't told why beforehand, running away to hide is a completely normal reaction.Also you can't have the frontman saying the game is fair and everyone has the same chances of winning when there is clearly favorism and nepotism. The second game is randomly easier for some players and harder for others. The protagonist is given a lot of aid in the third and fourth games just because the organizer liked him. Not to mention how they tell them at first the winners can share the money amongst them and midway they change it to only one can stay alive and get all the money for himself.Without fair play it was impossible to care about any of the characters. Whenever they show their personal lives it feels like vapid emotional manipulation, since you are never given any reason to assume they can win because they deserve it. They are killed at random. The best parts are when they can use some sort of strategy or to indirectly cheat the rules, but those moments are not many and don't matter in the longrun since the winner was predetermined. Not only that, the last episode desperately tries to offer social commentary and to be deep about humanity and kindness. It all falls flat on its face because it's too late to do anything about it, it is told to the predetermined winner, and is told by a guy who was fooling around and then pretended to be dead.This show is often compared to Kaiji and although there are similarities it is nowhere near as good. Over there the players were told what is at stake right away and there was a lot more strategy and deception instead of gory deaths based on luck. Losing didn't mean death and you could retry to play. Squid Game is a dumb variant of death games and comes down to shocking deaths, hollow drama, and vapid criticism of capitalism. As such it's nothing special in the longrun.

186,11ovz11,This was fun!,7/10,4 October 2021,"I found this drama to be well executed and entertaining.Were there bad plot holes?Yes.Did the VIPs episode suck?Yes.But did that hinder the overall series?No.Because, this drama, despite its gruesome violence, is pretty light. It doesn't have a deeper message nor a plot that makes you stop and think a lot. At one point, it's just a game and you even stop feeling for whoever that dies.Pros:
Good actingThe childish games with a twist were funLight plot, easy to follow.Uncomplicated charactersStellar castCons:
VIPs episodePoliceman's story line, how he gets into a highly secured center being undetected was unrealistic, also how come his phone battery lasted for 6 days without dying?Characters did not have much depth (except for the girls and Ali)Anyway, I have been watching kdrama for a while now, and I should say Squid Game is not the best kdrama I have seen. But it definitely is not the worst. It's a fun ride. With awesome OSTs and BGs. Everyone should check this out."
187,mertafor,Top notch show,8/10,9 October 2021,"As in the title says, this show is great. Already people made detailed comments and I won't have anything futher to add. But I'd like to point out two things.First one is complaints about predictability. I strongly disagree that view. Until the last second of the game, you'll be wondering who is going to be the winner. Because the balance between characters is consistenly changing thanks to great storytelling and it makes you reconsider who deserves to win during the entire show.Second thing is apparently people annoyed by the performances of VIP actors. It's true, VIP actors are really b type movie actors yet they have very short amount of screen time. Therefore it doesn't affect the overall experience in my opinion. If you're a person who has watched many other asian productions like me, it won't be a problem at all. Whenever a British or American actor is being seen on Asian movies (both chinese and Korean), you'll find their performance laughable anyways. Actors here reminds me IP Man 2. Regardless this is not a serious issue to lean on.In short, don't miss it out and believe the hype. Definitely deserves to watch."
188,jannikpeveling,Love Korean thriller & drama,9/10,12 October 2021,"I put it on my watchlist because I absolutely love korean thrillers.

I hope that more people love korean movies and series now as much as I do. Very nice, didn't disappointed and is as good as I expected when putting it on my watchlist.

I don't understand why they came into the show so late. You figure they would have liked to see it from the beginning to quench their thirst for seeing people suffer but they didn't. They should have just cut them out of the script. Otherwise an excellent series.

195,teenydutton,New creative series!,10/10,27 September 2021,"I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!

197,aldo-64339,BTEC Black Mirror,4/10,13 October 2021,"What's with all the hype??My biggest problem with this are the characters. I just don't care for them, very two dimensional and not very well drawn.The concept is nothing ground breaking. Seen it done before and better. Also don't bother with the dubbed audio, you'll end up laughing.Found myself bored in quite a few of the episodes also.Overall, I just didn't care, not the worst thing I've ever seen but nowhere's near worthy of the hype it received.

198,awfulketchup,Perfection!,10/10,21 September 2021,"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!

Like in 'parasite', it again shows social inequality issues of South Korea.The series is a high-quality work and It's visuals are strong to build suspense very effectively.Recommending to watch original Korean audio with English subtitles. And yes, it can be addictive one to binge watch!

200,ilpo-surokivi,Not for the squeamish,8/10,14 October 2021,"There's a lot of blood and violence in my opinion. I often wonder which is the more accurate one. Does blood gush out if a bullet pierces a person and how much. Is it like tiny not visible droplets that couldn't be caught on camera and then there's blood pouring from the wound I doubt it's a splatter fest.The social commentary was elsewhere too but I found the voting scene most fascinating. How half of the players wanted to get the money and risk their life. I get that many of the players were desperate but can't these people get even a litt paying job rather than play in the squid game. I'll rather work at a McDonald's than risk my life.

The show would have been smarter to keep them all silent and have them look tough and mysterious. The moment they started opening their mouths and started walking, they looked and sounded like average American Joes with average intelligence and an average strut. The show died there.Ep 8 Predictable progression, predictable ending, boring.Ep 9 total waste of time. Just drags on for too long.

204,rallder19,What the hell was this..?,6/10,25 September 2021,"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.

206,Valentijn78,A bloody masterpiece,10/10,3 October 2021,"Squid Game has a very high body count, and lots of gore to go with it. But even while the blood is spattering, the focus is on the characters, their relationships with each other, and the mysteries they're unraveling. The attention to detail in every aspect of the series elevates it from enjoyable and entertaining to truly exceptional.The sets in the Game are mostly simple, with a childish surreality. Yet also artfully designed for the impact that they have, and exquisitely memorable.Usually when the acting is good, we don't notice or think about it. But there were several times that actors displayed their emotions which such perfectly controlled subtlety that you have to stop to admire it: the uncontrollably trembling chin of an actor pushing himself to the edge of tears to do honor to the scene, or an actor's blank face with the character's emotions ""betrayed"" by only the twitching of one eye.Needless to say, the directing and production must have also been top-notch to create these scenes and put them together to tell such a simple but compelling story. The emotional impact is also carefully crafted: somehow, in the midst a huge number of violent deaths, the audience is left sobbing for half of an episode as both developed and undeveloped characters face impending death.And ultimately, there is a fairly clear moral to the story. But that will have more impact if it's seen and felt, instead of described here."

208,adotson-98233,"A truly engaging, and horrific look at reality",9/10,2 October 2021,"""Squid Game"" is one of the best Netflix shows to come out in a long time. It's a truly twisted yet inventive show filled with amazing performances and terrifying situations.This show truly kept me engaged throughout all its 9 episodes. The characters are absolutely amazing. Each character is truly fleshed out in their own ways making you care about some yet hate others. The acting is amazing. Each actor gives a commented, realistic, and terrified performance, and it feels real. The games too are very fun to watch. Some are quick and fast, while others are slow and terrifying. It's a very inventive premise for a show. Also the show truly made me cry. It's a show that succeeds at making you love characters too much. And that will result in you crying at certain things that happen in the show. The show also just has a real look at what it's like living in debt. It's makes you think whether it's worth it to risk your life to get money.I have but ONE little issue with the show. The first 2 episodes are just a little slow. I feel that they could've been better paced, but that's it.""Squid Game"" is a truly amazing show that has amazing performances, fleshed out characters, a real look at reality, and a premise that's so creative that it's almost impossible to enjoy."

214,yooniverse,"Shockingly good thriller, ending a bit weak",7/10,29 September 2021,"A battle royale-style concept that's been done many times in different forms (e.g., Alice in Borderland, 3%, Hunger Games, etc.), but there's just something in the way that Korean artistic style makes even the most cliched story lines interesting again. The first episode felt a little sluggish, but gets going by the end, and boy does it get going!The show is thoroughly enjoyable and gripping to watch, but gets predictable towards the end. Not only that, I think the writers ran out of shocking novel ideas about how to stage the namesake game in the end. But by then, you may just appreciate the relief of a straight-forward conclusion.Definitely binge-worthy! Though they could make a sequel/season 2, I don't think they should--it doesn't really need it, nor leaves you wanting more.

216,forthatusage,Dissapointing ending,5/10,25 September 2021,"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.

220,edwin-wks,A limp to the finish line,8/10,9 October 2021,"Squid Game deserves its hype overall but is still marred by glaring inconsistencies and poor story-telling. One can infer from the focus on Gi Hun as the protagonist that he would at least make it to the final game, if not win it. It would have been better had they given 10 mins in the first episode to tell the backstories of Gi Hun, Sang Woo, Sae Byeok, Ali, Deok Su and Mi Hyeon, so that it would appear each of them have an equal chance at winning. Seven more things that compromise the story are:1. The organ harvesters planned their entire operation down to the cremation furnace with a floor that dropped the coffin to a room below. Yet they did not arrange a surgeon to pose as a staff member and instead relied on a player to dissect the bodies in exchange for information about the next game.2. The Front Man is Jun Ho's missing older brother. You would think he could have just lied to his younger brother about his whereabouts and paid in advance for his rent. Why was he even renting a place or running Squid Game if he was the winner from 2015 and supposedly had all that prize money?3. With the conclusion of Game 5, the glass bridge is blown to tiny smithereens and the glass shard that hits Sae Byeok is the size of a kitchen knife?4. A less-than-convincing melee between Sang Woo and Gi Hun in the final game. Gi Hun is unable to finish the game and eliminate Sang Woo. Sang Woo suddenly finds his conscience and kills himself. This is completely inconsistent to the person who sacrificed anyone in his way to get ahead. What an anticlimax.5. Gi Hun mopes about due to survivor's guilt, leaving Sang Woo's mom saddled with her son's debt and Sae Byeok's brother languishing in the orphanage for a whole year.6. Squid Game started in 1988. Hundreds of people disappear from Seoul in the same month every year and it raises no eyebrows. Collective missing person reports would trigger police looking into CCTV footage of these people and they would come across footage of the Squid Games recruiters.7. The final scene sees Gi Hun turning away from boarding his flight to see his daughter in America. Presumably to try and get into the next Squid Games. How exactly? They know who he is and what he looks like. If he wishes to blow the lid on the game, he could have taken the card to the police, have them track down the original owner of the card and listen in as the invitee calls the Squid Game coordinator. End scene. Better set-up for season 2 instead of some irresponsible father letting his kid down again.

221,karimnn,Absolute garbage,1/10,9 October 2021,"I watched two episodes and I had enough. There's nothing here, terrible acting, unoriginal concept (I've seen a half dozen movies that resemble this series). I honestly do not understand what the hype is about, the only thing I can guess is that the producers and Netflix paid a huge amount of money to market this show. I see a LOT of Stanley Kubrik wanna be here, from the masks (Eyes Wide Shut), the music (On the Beautiful Blue Danube) the surrealism (The Shining), the gore (A Clockwork Orange), and there is nothing wrong with being influenced or even try to imitate art, however this series is simply too weak and Kubrik's imitation is a failure in my opinion. If anyone is impressed by this then they must be watching reality TV all day long.

222,doubtitall,Extremely good dark action thriller except for one major flaw.,8/10,19 September 2021,"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.

223,a_filmcritter,"artistic storytelling, visual masterpiece",9/10,24 September 2021,"Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling
Cons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators."

226,lanycera,The last 3 episodes didn't conclude it well.,7/10,9 October 2021,"I have to agree with others: I really didn't like the last three episodes and the wrap-up was dissatisfying. ""Gganbu"" was one of the strongest episodes in an emotional perspective, yet the last episodes tracked back with the reveal of the ""one"" behind everything on one of the most interesting relationships they set up through the entirety of the show.They also left one of the most interesting characters who had so much potential completely behind, Sae-byeok, and completely invalidated the sacrifice of Ji-yeong and the impact of their scene - which was a shame.The VIP's were stereotypes, horrible actors, and extremely unnecessary. I hated every second on screen they appeared and their absolutely dumb commentary.Up until Episode 7, I would have given it a 9 or 10. Episode 7 onwards was a 4 for me. 10+4 / 2 = 7 stars overall.

227,hydralien-40230,Pointlessly bloody,4/10,4 October 2021,"It's hard to understand the killing by numbers appeal - it's expressive and shocking and bizarre, but mass-murder is mass-murder. Whatever the plot, it's just unnecessary and fairly uninventive after first shot - once you understand the game rules and one person breaks them and gets shot, the rest is the same dull murderous routine for another 5 minutes.At the same time it's hard to sympathise thieves and gamblers - their lifestyle is by no means a death verdict, but they're not a relatable bunch either. Plus the acting is terrible, maybe save the old man, the Indian guy and the masked folks as long as they're wearing the masks.Cinematography good though, and maybe there's a great reveal up ahead - but I'm very reluctant to go past episode 3 for the reasons above.

230,sanjeevanwar,Dark and intense,9/10,11 October 2021,"Anwar Says : Last week, there was absolutely nothing to watch on Hindi OTT and I decided to go for much talked about Squid Game on Netflix, a Korean dark and disturbing series. 9 long episodes and would force you for a binge watch.You have everything in the plot , childhood games , killing, inhumanity, hatred , emotions, sentiments , and above all mind game . Out of 456 contestants, all down with debts are ready to sacrifice their lives to earn money, sounds a familiar subject but the Netflix team has converted it to unnerving deadly battle.Premise is simple and the characters are introduced quite fast but smoothly. If you loose you are killed and your guessing is not correct every time. Don't want to be a spoiler, so not narrating the story and the games .The lead Lee Jung- Jae gets answers to all his questions in the last episode.Watch the series with sub- titles on , in spite of the fact the dubbing in English is of quality par excellence . The masked jump- suits used by the guards are going to be the favourite this Halloween . Already running at top spot since a fortnight.9 out of 10 from me .#Nerflix

Sexual, verbal ,physical, just plain, coarse ,cruel and bloody-minded violence. Absolutely not reccomended to everyone under the age of 18.Regarding the plot , there was some parts with no reason. For example the whole story about the policeman was just unnecessary as he was not involved with the main characters.In my opinion only the last episode tried to ""save"" the whole disturbing face of the drama showing a more human side , and giving the moral message that money don't bring happiness.

234,PriestMarmore,Definitely a must watch if you haven't,9/10,11 October 2021,"Firsts things first, the series is really well made and has a very well thought and written story.Speaking of story, this one was super realistic in regards to what would happen if such a situation were to happen, the only 2 problems I had were thinking of a way someone could be that rich to afford such facilities and to buy a island for themselves while keeping everything unsuspicious. Talking about unsuspicious, problem number 2 is how would 456 be kidnapped and no one would notice? Other than that I have no other critic to the story, well done, realistic and interesting.Image wise it is as impressive as a series gets. The sceneries are beautifully well made. Interesting camera angles for a series as well.Lastly I want to point something out, a technicality that I noticed (and like I noticed this one I might have missed many others or there might not even exist any other, I don't know). When they are at the Tug of War, when a team loses they all fall down the bridge. I also noticed that it takes a few seconds for the blade to cut the rope. If putted the pieces together then shouldn't the winning team fall down the bridge as well duo to the massive weight difference, especially when it's a team with 3 women vs one full of men and the team with the women wins (meaning the team with only men is heavier)?To finish, the series is not perfect but it is pretty damn high up there.

235,suego-49293,"The story is intriguing, the dubbing is very poor",6/10,25 September 2021,"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).

239,tavives,Not really getting what some others are seeing in this.,3/10,11 October 2021,"This is a very strange series. It's like a cross between Logan's Run, The Hunger Games, Lost, Lord of the Flies (not to mention M. C. Escher) and a number of other dystopian books/movies that have come out over time. I grant that the way the story is told is somewhat original, and as an example of Korean drama, I suppose it gets a few points for raising that profile....But seriously...WTF!!!!!The dialogue, is addition to being almost juvenile at times, is made even more excruciating by the absolutely horrible, over the top, beyond melodramatic delivery by both the original Korean actors and the those doing the English dub. But even the scenes in English (the VIPS) was ridiculous, so while this may be intended and a normal quality of Korean cinema, it doesn't automatically make it good or even ok. My score of 3 is almost exclusively due to this. It made the show nearly unwatchable. Maybe this makes more sense in the original Korean and would have been better served by English subtitles. I don't know.I also question the premise for the show in the first place. Yeah, times are tough, but would people really be that morally depraved? After the first round when they were allowed to leave, I find it difficult to believe that anyone would come back no matter how difficult their situation was on the outside. And how could anyone ever possibly emotionally separate their ""winnings"" from how they were acquired? And while the ""1 year later"" epilogue does cover this to some extent, I mean really, what kind of horrible, sad, miserable life is Gi-hun going to have? Obviously they're planning a second season, so maybe we'll find out more, but I don't think I really care .Also, as we learn more about the operation of the contest itself, more questions arise. First you wonder how they explain all the deaths. Then when you realize they are harvesting organs, you have to ask why a sudden influx of supposedly anonymous organ donations wouldn't be questioned by someone. And wouldn't there be a sudden flurry of missing persons reported that the authorities would be looking into? I get it. It's a fantasy dystopian thing, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief on this point.However, I liked the creepy use of Tchaikowsky's waltz from ""Serenade for Strings"", Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" and ""Fly Me to the Moon"" and found it to be one of the more interesting aspects.But again, seriously......WTF!!!P. S. How again is the game court supposed to look like a squid?

241,georgewhittingham1,Good show - super over hyped though,8/10,3 October 2021,"This is a good show; the concept is good, the acting from the main cast is solid, it deserves to be watched by the masses.But; it's not a great show... it has some plot holes, as well as some terrible acting by the American characters (I won't include any spoilers, but I guarantee you'll know what I mean)All I've seen these past few weeks is the serious hype surrounding the show, and as someone who is a bit of a film buff, it needed an honest review. Go watch it, you'll enjoy it, but please don't claim it as the best show ever.

242,Money4Nothing,Overhyped,6/10,8 October 2021,"Ok first and foremost hear me out, it's Jigsaw but made in a larger environment, with bigger budget and more techy stuff, with same poorly executed and barely noticeable subtle society criticism. Is it watchable? Yes it is. Is it ground breaking, revolutionary, never seen before kind of story that people will remember and passionately talk about even 10 years from now; like the overhype wants you to believe? Absolutely not. Acting is probably the worst part of this show, characters are hard to believe and sympathize with with almost no character development, the way you see them in the first episode is the way they stay for the rest of it... All in all, for people who for some reason tend to fetishize Korean production and for people who want to be up to date with what TikTok is talking about this is a must watch, for everyone else watch if you want but even if you skip it you're not missing anything.

243,brucecsnow,Shocks and pulls you in,9/10,26 September 2021,"Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don't give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained.

1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character .

250,zachary-68690,This is one of my favourite Korean shows now.,8/10,21 September 2021,"The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The ""games"" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt's great, watch it."
251,tpcatoz-90650,"A pleasant, thrilling surprise",9/10,6 October 2021,"When I first started Squid Game I didn't expect much. Just something to pass time at work.

I highly recommend watching if you are looking to have some entertainment for a couple hours.

253,skanklover_69,Saw meets Oldboy in a nutshell,10/10,29 September 2021,"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.

254,indiana1981,Slightly overrated,6/10,4 October 2021,"This show isn't as amazing as everyone is making it out to be. It's definitely entertaining to watch, but it doesn't have any more substance to it than that. Maybe because I've watched this after the ""raging hype"", but I personally don't think this is a new concept at all.The acting is decent and it's filmed well, but my rating went down from 7 to 6, due to the explanation we're given as to why the games exist in the first place.Perhaps a lot of the viewers haven't seen Battle Royal and generation Z have only just discovered violent asian cinema.

255,NixSar,A hole in search of a plot,4/10,5 October 2021,"It could have been great - human selfishness exposed through worst excesses of capitalism, emotional struggles and ridiculously tough life and death choices, great sets, plenty of villains and drama.Instead, it is so unbelievably full of plot holes that it could only work as a parody, perhaps even really well. Unfortunately, Squid Game takes itself more seriously than a 19th century psychiatrist. It oozes heaviness and deep philosophy that its clownishly overacting cast (VIPs are the least of the show's problems) just cannot bear out.

259,Snownoise,A satire of korean society and nostalgia,7/10,17 September 2021,"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.

263,bangotti,Another gem from South Korea,9/10,30 September 2021,"I agree with others about the VIPs acting and line being awful. I watched it dubbed in English, so it could be translation, or voice acting that went awry. Otherwise the dub was quite good(well for dub standards). I think I'll be watching it a second time with just subtitles.South Korean cinema has become so popular in the West because it carries a certain gravitas and detail many western movies lack these days. I'm far from a film buff who looks forward to Tribeca or Sundance, but I can confidently say there is a distinct discipline displayed in South Korean films and shows. From the emotions on display by talented actors, to scripts that rely more on showing over telling, to the amazing seeds sown early that lead to payoffs later. And it's all wrapped up in great cinematography.Squid Game is no different. It might not reach the heights of OldBoy or Parasite or even I saw the Devil, and is a little more predictable. But it is a must watch for fans of South Korean films."

267,burgerman93,Quality show and extremely suspenseful,8/10,11 October 2021,"One would think that a miniseries centered around a gameshow would be stale after a while, but this series is top notch. I did think some elements of the story were hard to grasp, however the show was suspenseful and included an interesting range of characters.The only downside for me was the finale. I would have expected more character development from GiHun.

270,blankyblank,It started great but got predictable and was wrapped up too quickly,8/10,9 October 2021,"First six episodes are great - excellent introduction of characters and how they got here, careful world-building, clever and shocking games with increasing suspense up to episode 6 which is the peak of the showBy episode 7 there are about 20 players left, with a couple of ""important"" characters. That's where the show goes downhill:the fifth game is almost entirely luck based and running order practically determines who will pass. It also weeds out a lot of players giving us finalists out of nowhere-the winner is predictable and almost all uncertainties are removed prior to the final game, that confrontation felt empty
VIPS are abomination and ruin these last 3 episodes by a lotThe cop - lost brother plot resolved in a very underwhelming wayFront man is still a mystery - how he got to that position and why, his only redeeming quality is cool maskThe host and the grand scheme are also very underwhelming and predictablethe 1 year later epilogue is just depressing, maybe that was the intentionAll in all, I feel it could've been better. It's like they've run out of ideas towards the end."

It is slow, veeeeryyy predictable, characters not relatable at all, long winded bathetic (yes that is a word) scenes, borderline annoying characters, no skill or smarts needed only luck, very poorly written ""twists"" that fail to be twists and so on... This is a huuuggeee disappointment.

272,AJx91,The Idea Is Not New,2/10,1 October 2021,"Saw films, Gantz anime, Alice In Borderland tv series, High Rise Invasion manga, and more have done this formula. Some of which have done this formula better.The only thing that Squid Game adds new, is that it is South Korea's own take on it, with a kdrama spin.At max, this is a 6 star at best, and a 2 star at its' worst. I'm just not as entertained, compared to other kdramas and survival game narratives (as listed above).

The main guy is an idiot and loser and not likable at all. But that is not the bad part. Why would you participate in something you have no idea what it is? They will offer you lots of money if you win? You don't think it could be dangerous? No one asked this? All other game shows that you can win money and prizes, don't drug you and have masked people. The first game was so stupid. Every single person moved at red light. Ever so slightly, but they still moved. And only some got shot? And all those people still ran after they saw guys get shot when they moved? Are they all idiots? And green light and red light switched on time, but when all those people got shot, it stayed red for awhile. Why? Really stupid. Also you know you can die so why continue playing. They never mentioned that you can't quit in the first episode. I would say f this I'm out after the first game.

274,AlienRefugee,Awesome show but there are quirks,8/10,1 October 2021,"The American voice actors don't really have the passion that the real actors have, so if you can live without the English dubbing then watch it with subtitles. Trust me, you'll understand why if you rewatch parts with the English overdubs. Also, there's a fair few writing issues and plot holes that may be just due to the way it was translated so it's not a flawless series but it's still a great series despite these letdowns.

279,majoreasy,Interesting and entertaining,6/10,3 October 2021,"This series gets a 6 overall...For the concept and cinematography, this deserves a 7... Well filmed and good use of lighting and colours... The costume was vibrant and eye catching but rather bland after a couple of episodes... Some parts felt disjointed and out of place...The script in terms of story and logic gets a 6... Some illogical occurrences and lapses in a supposedly tightly controlled environment... Some characters seem to overreact all the time while some felt detached and unaffected...""normal"" people seldom react similarly under duress but a few characters do not seem involved...a few act overly cool towards ""friends"" and a few overly warm towards ""adversaries""...
Perhaps there were too many characters to properly develop but even the main ones aren't 'likeable' enough to root for... And most of the plot became predictable before the half way mark..The acting was the major let down for me and scored between a 4 and a 5.... While there were some great moments yet generally throughout, acting weren't believable... Fear and anger felt under whelming, aggression and obnoxious behaviours seemed overplayed... And some characters over act to clownish proportions...a few of the characters also don't feel consistent, suddenly brave then turn cowardly or vice versa...I found most of the characters unrelatable at many points of the story development... This is partly the fault of the script but the acting or over-acting didn't help...Can't say much more without giving spoilers away... Overall, quite enjoyable but not one where I felt the need to keep chasing the next installment... Continue watching was to just check if my prediction is somewhat accurate instead of a need to find out what happens next... This point is where I feel the series is a let down...Combining the above assessment, an average score of 5.5 to 6 seems fair... Wish they paid more attention to the details... Game of thrones this isn't, well maybe just a below par season 8 of GOT... ""Could have been much better"" is the general feeling..."
280,kyrross,"Great idea, well executed, outdated trope and over the top acting",5/10,6 October 2021,"I get why this show is so praised. The idea is simple yet very well executed. The asthetic and decors, and musics are amazing. BUT, the dialogs, the script and the acting are way over acted. Nobody talk like any of the character and it is sometimes really awkward. It is even more obvious when VIP talks. It is painfull to watch.There are all the stereotypical characters we have seen a million time : The benevolent hero, the cool/cold chick, the mysterious connection, the old wise man, the pure villain.... and when you start to think about the entire plot, nothing make sense. Also, the twist ending is way too predictable. I called it on episode 2 and then told myself ''no, they wouldnt go there, it is way too easy''. Yep, they totally did. This show could have been made in the 80's and then maybe, they would have some original idea. Aside from the premise, a lot of trope are copy paste from american's thriller.I was dying lauging when the face scan his mask.

281,nilsurban-50399,"Solid, but nothing more...",6/10,20 September 2021,"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting."

Story is simple a group of people play children's games and who loses will die. Even it is children's games it will keep you at the edge. That's also the speciality of the series.This series will never going to disappoint you It's worth every bit of your time.

289,joncolley,Fantastic series let down by a slightly meh finale,8/10,4 October 2021,"Ok, I have to get this off my chest. It really annoys me when people just don't give a realistic review of movies and tv shows because giving something 10 and saying 'best thing ever!' or a 1 (or even 0) and saying 'worst thing ever!' serve no purpose except to feel the gap some people have in their life for a hobby... I find it especially annoying when people rate something zero and say 'I was bored after 10 minutes so turned off' - hey buddy, don't review it then if you're not mature enough to invest some time! Go watch some Tik Tok videos instead!Ok, rant over lol.I put this on for the sake of having something in the background while I worked from home. It was a huge mistake as I kept concentrating on the show with work in the background! Sorry boss :) I did however change it to other ""stuff"" when I realised it was a show I wanted to watch.The basic premise is simple - people with huge debts and nothing really to live for are offered a part in 6 games and the winner gets huge amounts of money. Simples. What they don't know is that they might die...I don't know how they do it, but Korea just nails it when it comes to creating characters that are fallible but likeable. They even make bad guys, real a-holes, somehow relatable and fleshed out so they're not just one dimensional villains.Anyway, I won't spoil anything for anyone except to say it's really very good :) It doesn't glorify the deaths, they're grim and matter of fact and as the series progresses, because they've developed characters and you've invested in them then their deaths hit pretty hard :( I sort of assumed that more would survive but this feels like it's completely self contained like they didn't expect a second series.Watch it, enjoy it - or not - just don't come in and review it like a child afterwards."
290,Kamil_An,Korea have outdone themselves; masterpiece,10/10,24 September 2021,"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2.

293,nielssloos-17186,"Almost perfect, but fails to stick to the bigger idea",7/10,5 October 2021,"Squid Games received a lot of buzz since it came out and it is easy to understand why. Around 400 people who have their own financial problems decide to join a tournament, in which they have to play kids games where the losers will be killed. The premise is similar to franchises such as the hunger games, and other violent movies that became popular after that franchise.And throughout the first couple of episodes we get kind of the same adrenaline filled experiences: the games are silly but due to the fact you get killed when you loose there is automatically tension. And eventhough it is pretty clear who will survive the first few games, audience still get what they want; a high body count and enough gore.When the stakes are getting higher, you start to realize that the show has more similarities to 'the most dangerous game' and 'The Cabin in the Woods'. And without going too much into spoilers, the power distance between certain characters is present in all these three names. And soon you start to realize that it is a bold move for an American company (Netflix) to produce such anti-American series. I just wish they stocked with this idea.Unfortunately, and maybe I am a bit too harsh in ranking it this low because of this, they completely flipped the premise on his head towards the end. And everything they build up in the previous episodes is wasted by a cheap plot twist that literally does not make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, the games are fun and there is plenty of tension, but it doesn't add up like The Cabin in The woods ended. The anti American propaganda is completely thrown out, and that is a huge dissapointment.Pros: the games, the violence, references to inequality
Cons: plot twist, predictability, ending.

It has excellent premise, gripping & binge-worthy development, perfectly handle twist & turns, fantastic character arcs and overall exceptional writing and acting!It's near the realm of perfection with little to complain but if I have to nitpick, my only minor gripes are:
1. Motivation revealed in last episode could have been more...philosophical (maybe it's lost in translation)
2. VIPs acting are really bad, like...they supposed to be world's richest a-holes, not jerk high schooler reading off a drama script...

297,davepasnthru,An indictment of the Capitalist System from a Marxist Point of View,1/10,10 October 2021,"What you must understand about Squid Game is that it fundamentally hates capitalism. It sees unequal OUTCOME us being unfair. One comment said something to the effect that ""Capitalism claims that there is equity and justice in the distribution of wealth"". NO IT DOESN'T! Capitalism idealy offers equality of opportunity, not equal or even just outcome. If you think you want EQUITY (equal outcome regardless of opportunity or effort) then you are probably a Marxist and are destined for disappointment. It has failed everywhere it has been tried.Capitalism, on the other hand, has lifted more people out of poverty than any other system devised by man. This is an indisputable fact. Do people get left behind? Yes unfortunately, which is why there are systems in place to help those people. But at no time has Capitalism offered ""Equity"" of wealth distribution.There is more and more of this kind of thing coming out of South Korea and you would think they would know better given their experience with Marxist North Korea."

299,cameronmcclure,Started off with serious flare and lost momentum,6/10,12 October 2021,"I've watched too many power house Korean movies for this to have much of an impact on me. Sounds very pretentious me saying this but if you've watched movies like Oldboy, memories of murder, chaser, I saw the devil, (these are just scratching the surface) then you'll know exactly what I mean. This just doesn't hit the same way they do, I feel like this could possible be because it is being released on Netflix but whatevs - I wasn't left gripping my seat the same way they do.Might not be a good thing honestly comparing this series to them with being completely different premises, but honestly this doesn't come close. What I love about this show is that it will open up a lot of people who aren't particularly regulars with watching something foreign, and show them what is out there to dive into and will break that barrier of entry down to make them go discover more film from this absolute master race of film makers, actors and story tellers. Mark my words NO ONE DOES IT BETTER THAN THE KOREANS. It's just a shame that because the popularity this has seen so far will start to cloud over the absolute master pieces these people are capable of and have produced."
300,gingeryzane,Incredible. Do not listen to the VIP reviews - Read Below.,10/10,26 September 2021,"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!

305,Roma73,Different and engaging but not 8.8... A 6 or 7 for me,7/10,10 October 2021,"Some of it was good, some of it very good, some of it not so good.My frowning moments were:*** spoiler alert **** When they started killing each other, 27 people in total: too soon and over the top. Here I considered giving it 5 stars at most.* The ending during which the bad guy has a sudden change of heart, with no convincing explanation.* The English speaking people were over the top and somehow not very convincing. All except the sexual predator, which did add to the creepiness.* The importance of money made no sense to me; yes, poverty is a nuisance, but to have it turn you into a killing machine? Nor did I understand the 1 winner only system. I don't recall it being specified that only 1 person could leave with the money (could've been made more clear in fact as the main character hopes to leave together with a girl). I personally think it would've been better and not damaging to the storyline if more people could've shared the prize merely by making it through all games alive. First of all there was enough money to go around for quite some people. But foremostly because I just don't believe ANYONE except a crazed psychopath would agree to being the single winner, meaning you have to watch everyone (everyone - 500 people!) die. And they chose this voluntarily too, when they came back for that second round. Really, if I handed you a lottery ticket with a 1 in 500 chance of winning but a 500 to 1 chance of killing you, would you take it?* Melodrama on various occasions where less would've been more.* Like others have said that one screaming, scheming female should've been toned down (or replaced by a less annoying actress).* I thought the twist at ending okay but the ending after that somewhat daft. He should have just done what he should've done at the get-go: give a darn about his daughter.* The character developement of the main character was poor. He's a selfish loser in the beginning and just the same in the end. Doesn't go see his daughter, doesn't share some of the money he won with the really poor. And his sudden change of morality just didn't ring true with me.BUT, having said all this, after seeing the similar series ""Alice in Borderland"", I have to say I thought this way better. It certainly had me hooked all the way through. So I'd still recommend it if this type of story is your thing. The cinematography was great. And - I came back to add this - it really WAS very colourful and creepy (those masks, with different ranks according to symbol, and the private island), and not mainstream, and very entertaining.

308,RoadSideAssistance,Okay but terrible ending and this has been done MANY times before....,6/10,3 October 2021,"Battle Royale, As The Gods Will (literally about kid's games in a death challenge environment), Alice in Borderland, Hunger Games, etc. And those are just the Asian ones...This really didn't do anything special or anything unique. The story dragged on during some moments, wouldn't be surprised if they were trying to stretch out the episodes. Episode 6 was the best one and had some of the show's best acting.The last 3 episodes were really bad and uninspired and clearly just meant to setup a season 2 which is annoying. All the character arcs are thrown out the window, a police officer investigating this deadly game has a lackluster ending, and the reveals.... meh? The 'protagonist' learns nothing by the end of the film, so there's zero character arc.I'll give it a 6. It's entertaining to watch the games and their thought process but I can't give it anymore than that thanks to the lackluster ending. Now an ending can be disappointing but I want rate an entire series on JUST an ending (like Game of Thrones). But the fact this did nothing new at all and flat out copied movies. People are saying some of the above movies I mentioned are fantasy, but there's another movie I can't think of where people volunteer to play for money in a very realistic setting that is basically the same thing...Nothing new, acting is OKAY, some major plotholes or scratch your head moments, and not a good conclusion. I know they're setting up for season 2, but how they set it up is pretty stupid. And I don't think it needs to go there to begin with."

I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days.

313,aliahmedashraf,It's good until the cop dies,5/10,20 September 2021,"Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he'll pay them in full ""next month"" but we learn that he hasn't touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun's mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop's brother ""won"" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl's little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they're crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn't shatter. It webs up as we see on a car's windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn't seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn't the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?

There were too many predictable and pointless subplots, and the level of melodrama started to get too high for my taste. Also, there were a couple of outrageously homophobic moments.All in all; the show was good and I enjoyed it, but expected something more based on all the hype.

315,nbutcher-69458,Playground politics for grown ups.,9/10,8 October 2021,"Dong-hyuk Hwang starts out with what seems to be a typical Korean drama and by the end of it we've been through ""Battle Royale"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Eyes Wide Shut"", and a Bond movie - complete with plot twists, Kubrik-esque visual easter-eggs, and social commentary delivered with a side-dish of disturbing trauma.Squid game is about a group of people recruited to play lethal games for prize money, but it is more than that. It is a commentary about the nature of human competition, the endless class war, the illusion of wealth. Read into it a bit more closely and you'll all about the levers of control our governments and rulers have over us all.The most obvious theme is the love and sacrifice that others have to make for us to succeed in life. Some people seem to think that this is a critique of capitalism, but capitalism isn't a zero-sum game like Squid Game is.With this deep commentary underlying the action - being carefully shown and not told to us - Squid Game is an unmissable watch.Negatives? The ending was a bit flat. It flirted with the idea of tying up all lose ends into a satisfying thematic conclusion - but in the end, the actual conclusion was a little less than satisfying and opened up more questions than it actually resolved. That's perfect for a sequel season - if we get one."
316,JTReviewsPlus,An interesting premise that's expertly crafted all around,9/10,19 September 2021,"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.

317,marinamaru,really?,2/10,5 October 2021,"Everything is predictable and nothing surprising happened about who survived the game and what happened at the end...the games had nothing like intelligent mind game, they are just a bunch of gambles plus trial of muscle strength which is completely a disadvantage for women. The masterminds, the fellows, rich vips, people who showed up in business scene etc are all male, also there were full of misogyny and insulting lines to women which supposedly old stereo type stupid males came up with. As a person who lives in an asian country near korea, there's no wonder. Those elements were just disgusting and there was nothing fun to watch this show. I just kept watching it expecting something mindblowing would happen at the end by high scored reviews but NO nothing at all. I just waisted my time.

320,schrilax,Overrated garbage,1/10,14 October 2021,"Could not relate to the story or any of the characters. Just didn't even care who lives, who dies. Loopholes in the story galore. Unnecessarily story lengthened which could have been much tighter. In the end was like *yawn* whatever. No issues with gore in movies, seen plenty in others but the story/acting/screenplay should hold and carry the movie through. This felt like it is riding on the wave movies like Parasite created for Korean cinema/TV. Bloated overhyped nonsense at best. Give it a skip and save your time.

322,thaicoons,Great potential ruined by overacting,6/10,18 September 2021,"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great.

324,susanneburns66,Fantastic show....but..,8/10,1 October 2021,"I didn't think the lead actor was likeable in the first episode but found myself rooting for him after episode 2. The games were so creepy. Children's games that if you lose, you die, in horrible bloody circumstances. Whittling the players down to one ultimate cash prize winner. So there's a lot of violence and death. Now, this programme could have been higher rated had it not been for one thing: The VIPs. My gosh how embarrassingly cringeworthy are they! They ought to be glad their faces were mainly hidden! I'm not sure if it was a budgeting thing and they were hired on the cheap as western actors. Or if their performances translated better for Korean viewers, as foreign actors. I doubt it though. They really let the show down. However, i'll still give it an 8 for the concept, production and delivery and the Korean actors.

Cinematography and script. -2 points because of the incredibly unlikeable, mostly pathetic main actor that is all in all acted like a terrible person to his family but not to everyone else. I didn't understand his motivation sometimes and he got quite annoying. The acting of the VIPs was a bit bizarre too.

So I'm overwhelmed and happy that Squid Game gets so much hype and is currently the most streamed series on Netflix. I've seen Ig Stories of my friends loving Squid Game. Even though they never watched Korean series or films before.I grant all the success from heart to Hwang Dong-hyuk. His plot for the series was rejected many times over the years by a lot of companies. They didn't believed in Squid Game.What I live about Squid Game is that it deals with pain & desperation. It shows what people are willing to do to get money.The actors were impressive during the entire season. Also recognized some familiar faces.The plot is not predictable and never lost it magic. I was there from the first to the last second fully focused on the screen.Squid Game & Move To Heaven are the best series on Netflix.10/10."

332,dystopian-galaxy,Very compelling until...,7/10,10 October 2021,"I was so intrigued to finally watch this and I managed to avoid spoilers. (Just a heads up this review and my opinions will contain spoilers so please steer clear if you want to avoid them yourself.)The whole concept of this series was pretty damn cool and very compelling. The sets, cinematography, music and character designs as well as their back stories were thought out and exceptionally done. Really amazing.The acting was all really good except for the VIPs... I was looking forward to meeting them so much; who they were and what their experience and involvement was but when they were introduced I feel that the series started to fall apart. There was an immersion that was broken upon their introductions and they didn't really serve any purpose either.All of the games and the main content of this show were really well done but the final three episodes really lost me. I wasn't as interested and the way it ended felt off to me. It wasn't a good wrap up at all. This was disappointing because the first five episodes were really edge of your seat kind of viewing.

336,luckyallstar,Decent show. Albeit somewhat overhyped and overrated.,7/10,13 October 2021,"After reading and seeing stories like Liar Game, Kaiji and multiple Battle Royale clones over 20 years ago this one doesn't bring anything new to the table. Not only isn't it the first, but Squid Game isn't even among the best of its kind.To be fair my main critique isn't the old concept. A more glaring issue is with some core points like the Jigsaw like reveal that I found rather predictable.The ending itself and Seong Gi-Hun's decision is incomprehensible as well. If you just think back to all the games it's clear that he only survived by luck or help or pity from the other contestants. There's really only one game to give him full credit for. Taking this into account his decision at the end of joining the next game doesn't make any sense.Aside from some character inconsistencies or rather incomprehensible acts by some characters like Seong Gi-Hun, Oh Il-nam and Front Man the characters were really great and fleshed out. Definitely one of the best things about this show.

337,onze-kris,Good until episode V.I.P,2/10,19 September 2021,"So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show.

342,luceruc,Gruesome & basic - like its intended audience,5/10,9 October 2021,"Which I guess includes me; after all, I did watch all 8 1/2 episodes with no one exactly aiming a gun at my head. But I did fast-forward through the most ridiculous parts, so.Tragically enough, I sense a degree of genius involvement somewhere along the line, probably at the very start of the Squid project. A writer with a vision and actual talent, ordered by some meathead producer to make the whole thing as vile and watchable as, say, the first instalment of Saw, and the writer (whom in this case, also got to direct it) did it so his or her family could eat. Or at least that's the take I can live with. But anyway: don't even get me started on the way Netflix treats their talent. I imagine their top execs are just like those revolting VIPs, more than capable of watching people die for fun.Such a shame that this Netflix fodder will be remembered as the Korean finest, while the real good - not Netflix - stuff, like Kingdom and Train to Busan, will most likely get buried under a relentless pile of total squid."
343,kristinesklarz,Bravo Korea!! USA mom/wife is now a fan!,8/10,30 September 2021,"I thought this Season of Squid Game was done so well. So many emotions and characters to follow. I never thought of South Korea as coming out with something so good...such a pleasant surprise. I can't wait for Season 2 (perfect ending to a great Season-obviously there will be a 2nd Season).Great job-keep up the good work!!Anyone worried about it being in Korean-just watch in English and put English subtitles on. You'll never know the difference.

344,Vinicius8,Funny Games,4/10,4 October 2021,"The brand new hype series of the season. Is it any good? With so many commenting about it and the massive number of positive reviews on this website, I dare ask the question everybody feels so confronted when asked: why? If you have seen the show and enjoyed it, please take a minute to consider the reasons for that. I feel like ""Squid Game"" has been given too much credit, and I will try to explain why without spoiling for those who still consider watching it.A few users on IMDb have already pointed out many incongruities in the story, unresolved plot points, character inconsistencies, unexplained details and while all of it is valid criticism, I could easily nitpick any number of flaws with the story, dialogue and characters, and not make a point. Aside from the fact that I don't want to spoil the series, I think it's more important to highlight the general idea of the show and why most plot holes, from small to gigantic, were a problem, instead of just listing them.To begin with, the premise is preposterous and nobody would think that to be feasible, therefore it's unreasonable to criticize the show for being unrealistic. We take what is given to us and suspend our disbelief until further notice. And that's where the issues begin. I can happily ignore certain details about HOW all of it came to be, if those details are never mentioned again. However, ""Squid Game"" takes an approach to its story that confronts the whole idea of its premise, setting it against rational inquiry of the facts shown to us. Simply put, its an absurd story trying to be realistic. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. Take ""The Platform"" for example: The absurd premise is justified by the bigger picture, a metaphor. ""The Platform"" doesn't dwell on the details of HOW it all came to be, or WHO is behind all of it. It doesn't matter, because the narrative structure only serves as a parallel between our's and the movie's reality. Then how does ""The Platform"" differ from ""Squid Game""? In favor of reliable (read: cliché) plot conflicts, the metaphor aspect comes crashing down in ""Squid Game"". For example, when the masked game enforcers are shown as human, it naturally begs the question: HOW did those people end up there? Now these characters are not an idea anymore, they are people, and people need stories. And guess what? They never get one.That problem repeats itself a number of times, most notably with the main characters' decisions, as they repeatedly take actions that are not in accordance with their already established characteristics. When they break character, it is in favor of a simple and predictable resolution to the problem faced. If they were to act accordingly to themselves, the story wouldn't go the authors' way. That would create conflicts the writers wouldn't know how to solve, therefore they end up relying on clichés to save themselves from that trouble.The way I see it, a story like this should have taken one of 3 approaches: realistic, fantastical or metaphorical.As a metaphor, ""Squid Game"" could've worked not unlike the aforementioned ""The Platform"", drawing parallels with the elements of the show and our reality.As a fantasy series, it could have gone down the same path as ""Alice in Borderland"". The realism wouldn't matter then and the mystery would be stronger.As a realistic show we would have something like ""Saló or 120 days of Sodom"". And it should've felt just as disturbing, after all, both stories are about powerful people playing with the lives of unfortunate souls. But that doesn't seem the point ""Squid Game"" wants to make, after all it puts us in the same place of the evil powerful men in masks: sitting comfortably in our sofas, relishing in the spectacle of violence, anguish and pain. But hey, that could be the point the show is making, right? You are just as bad as those evil men! You are enjoying this show too! But no, ""Squid Game"" doesn't confront you with that notion, like Michael Haneke did with ""Funny Games"". You are to mindlessly enjoy the carnage and ask no further questions. Are you satisfied? Don't worry about answering that. Keep yourself busy. Watch another episode before you have time to ask yourself another silly question."

347,ejh-60622,Not that good,6/10,13 October 2021,"Unlike some other comments, this is LIKE other things I've already seen or heard of. It's a built on a bunch of different already used ideas, and put together into a smart package that pleases the directed target group (which is basically everyone), which was *told* to watch and enjoy this show. Marketing wise these creators hit the jackpot and the hype train is real.Almost any fast going series can get really captivating and easy to binge nowadays, and the only thing original is that this one got to the extreme when it comes to exposure and word-of-mouth.I'm not saying it's a bad series but when the hype is over and people might reflect again it will probably be viewed as the 6 to 7 rated series that it is. Those who can recite the happenings in the series a month after watching it are welcome to prove me wrong though."

There's a good story line to follow but I found it a bit excessive when it came to blood but being a horror fan, I was able to deal with this part of the series. On the whole, the series is a study in human behavior especially under critical conditions and I'm sure this show will be a required study in all psychology classes. IMO, I feel as though the writers were paying homage to Stanley Kubrick and his portfolio of work. See if you can see the similarities as you get deeper into the story line. There are 9 episodes which last about an hour and one that's about 30 minutes long. There's been much talk about it on social media and that's given it a boost in viewership but all in all it kept my attention enough to see how it was going to end. I gave it an 8 since it drew me into watching the whole series....

364,Mauseum,Solid,7/10,26 September 2021,"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?

365,laurynl,NOT Your Typical K-Drama,10/10,28 September 2021,"If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don't get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one.

367,curiousbush,Cool concept but way too cheesy,6/10,8 October 2021,"The concept carries the film. It's really interesting, but unfortunately the player interactions are sooo cliche and corny. They're like the last seasons of the Walking Dead, for those that have seen them. The ending game especially was just so bad. They tried to establish ambiguity about the main character's ethos in the first episode, but it all goes out the window and he becomes just 100% angelic good guy, which is frustrating and annoying to watch.I still enjoyed it, I suppose, but with each episode I liked it less and less. It's fine to entertain yourself for a week but it isn't something to come back to.

370,bruninho-loopes,Weak,6/10,30 September 2021,"First off, this show is worth a watch, despite my rating for it. It is entertaining and gets you hooked (though it definitely won't get you hanging on the edge of your seat). The problem is: the plot is weak, riddled with clichés, and full of plot holes.There is no such thing as a surprising plot twist in this show. After the first couple of episodes, you already know exactly what is going to happen. As I said, it is okay to watch when you have nothing else to see, but, in my honest opinion, it is super undeserving of its 8+ rating and not at all worth all the hype.Here's a small, very limited, list of a few issues I found with it. (ATTENTION: SPOILERS):
What are the odds that, in a group of 201 people, they would make a vote and that vote would be split exactly in half, with the last one to vote being the tie-breaker? Seriously, I think that the odds of that vote ending 101 to 100 are less likely than the odds of a show like that existing in real life.They talk a big game about how they strive to provide a space that is equal for everyone, and are even apologetic when something doesn't go according to that rule. Well, sorry to say, but if you allow the very OWNER of the criminal organization play the games and not suffer any consequences when he loses, then you are absolutely NOT providing a fair and leveled playing field for everyone. Also, the dude with the tattoo got MULTIPLE benefits throughout the show. Here are a few:1. When someone threatened to kill another player, they would instantly face the threat of being killed themselves by the show staff. However, when tattoo dude kills someone in front of the staff, he suffers no consequence whatsoever.2. Tattoo guy agreed to play the marbles game one way. However, when he started to lose, he cried foul to the staff and they actually allowed him to change the game (seriously, that was ridiculous plot armor for him)
3. Whenever someone refused to play a game, they would instantly face the consequences, as people needed to keep playing to provide the VIPs with more entertaining value in the finale. When tattoo dude refuses to play on the glass game, however, absolutely nothing happens to him. Seriously?Anyways, back to the regular stuff:
The plot, as I previously mentioned, is constantly obvious and easy to guess. Everyone knew the smart dude would become a villain, everyone knew that the lady that didn't find a partner for that marble contest would be left alive, and everyone knew that tattoo dude was not going to lose that marble game because he just had the most incredible, unbreakable plot armor in history. It was also obvious as heck that the competition that was in pairs was going to make one character play against the other. And they acted like all of those were like huge plot twists. Do you think your audience is that stupid?There is no real tension that leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat throughout the show because the main characters are the only ones that are thoroughly explored, and you either love them or hate them. No matter what happens, you ALWAYS know that the team in which the protagonist is on is going to win, and you can always figure out who is going to win or lose in all contests. In the marble contest, again, they had MULTIPLE opportunities to actually introduce a valuable plot twist, but no. Face tattoo dude lives, protagonist lives, smart guy lives, north korean girl lives, crazy lady lives. You can just see the producers were desperate to keep these characters on because they, themselves didn't have enough faith in their work to think that it would be able to sustain itself after killing off a main character.Another RIDICULOUS plot device was the body of the guard that the police officer killed washing up exactly on the island were they were holding the games, when he threw the body off of the boat in THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. That scene was completely unnecessary and broke my immersion on the show even more.Are you telling me that Ali, a guy who came all the way from Pakistan to live in South Korea ACTUALLY managed to learn how to speak Korean, one of the most difficult languages for non-native speakers, flawlessly and perfectly, but didn't know what even or odd numbers were? REALLY? SERIOUSLY?And then there is the ending. So, this show is going to tell me that that stupid main character, who did absolutely nothing throughout the show, didn't even manage to win it by himself, is now going to take on a whole criminal organization that even has its own island? The dude is going to go from a jackass who can't even wipe his own butt and lives off of his mother's money in his 30s to a John Wick type of guy who can destroy anything he touches? What a terrible ending to a severely underwhelming show.There are many more ridiculous plot holes to be talked about, those are just some of the highlights. However, since this review is already long enough, I'm going to leave it here.Very mediocre show. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to see, but do not believe the hype. 6/10 (being very generous).

372,paulyew-45125,Atrocious translation,6/10,19 September 2021,"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.

376,The_Geek_Spot,Awesome..Loved it!,10/10,22 September 2021,"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would."

If you have watched the show, you'll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The ""VIP's"" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn't help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn't a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.

However, this one has Korean Cinema stylishness, great cinematography, good directing and acting. Story and characters lack logic most of the time so just enjoy the colorful and gore world of Squid Game. Do not expect flawless story or deep social messages or grand philosophy because there is none.

Not just once...Overacting, seen mostly in Chinese kung-fu flicks, hit me after 15 minutes. So I quit. But not quite, since my kids loved the show, and I gave it another try, watching complete 1st episode and half of the 2nd one. That's when I could not stand it any longer. The plot is quite predictable, the actors make stupid faces and a lot of unnecessary noise and movements. It just got plain silly and boring. Seen this story somewhere, or read some books with similar plots, I do not really remember. The point is: this crap of a series pretends to deliver some kind of message on greed, and people in need doing things they normally would never do... But it simply does not deliver, at least not to me. Been there, seen this somewhere.

388,angeldwa,Will make you feel so many things,7/10,3 October 2021,"I don't know how to feel about this series, it left me with so many feelings. I have to say that I liked it for that reason. I was very uncomfortable watching the show, but something kept me watching. There were some plot holes that other people have mentioned already. I also think that some of the gruesomeness was a bit unnecessary. I understand that the gore was a big part in the whole show, but some of the scenes were a little too much. Otherwise, definitely worth a watch.

391,azenyaan,Movies based on reality in life,9/10,7 October 2021,"This film is great, it deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. Apart from Squid games, there are many other survival games genre films, but what distinguishes Squid Game from other films of the same genre is that it departs from the real reality of human life. People in debt look for all kinds of ways to pay off their debts, even if they risk their lives. Meanwhile, among the rich, the struggle of the poor becomes entertainment for those who are tired of a life that is always fulfilled. This reality is sad, but this is what actually happened.In the end, when the 456th player has won the first prize and the billions of prizes, he does not find happiness because he has sacrificed the lives of his friends. Money becomes meaningless and his life is not like it used to be.

392,azenyaan,A film that departs from social reality,9/10,8 October 2021,"This film is amazing, deserves to be a phenomenal film this year. The selected players can portray the characters well, especially Kang Sae Byeok. There are many other films with the theme of survival games, but what distinguishes squid games from others is that it departs from the issue of social reality in society. Squid game provides a heart-wrenching reality that humans who are in huge debt are willing to do anything, including selling their lives for a deadly game. As for the conglomerate people who are tired of having got everything they want in life, they see the hardships of the poor as entertainment. In the end, the winner of this game realizes that winning money by killing others is not something fun, so the 456 billion is meaningless. This is what I think makes the Squid game very popular.

393,bradleycarrington,Masterfully crafted Story about human nature and desperation,10/10,3 October 2021,"The three things that I look for when watching something are storytelling, performance, and attention to detail. Squid game passes all of those with flying colors. The storytelling and atmosphere is incredible, well thought-out, and keeps you invested from start to finish. Going into this, I thought that a show about deadly children's games would get cheesy at points, but boy was I wrong. This show digs deep into the psyche of the characters and delivers some very powerful and emotional scenes, which the actors absolutely nail. There isn't much to say about the acting other than each of these actors (with the exception of the VIP's that spoke English) deliver phenomenal performances that take you on an emotional Rollercoaster. Lastly, I'm the type of person that will pause shows to spot inconsistencies or plot holes as they are very telling for how seriously the creators took the show/movie. I can tell how invested everyone that worked on this was because I didn't catch a single inconsistency. It seemed like every single detail was thought out and carefully crafted.This show is brutal, bleak, and doesn't sugar coat anything or deliver any corny cliche's. It feels authentic from start to finish. Definitely not a feel good show or for the faint of heart, but would absolutely recommend giving this a watch."
394,laurentbauwin,Almost perfect,9/10,10 October 2021,"Battle Royale made the path so I can't give the 10 stars because that movie paved the way for this show.If you don't like thrillers sparkled with a bit of gore, you'd better pass, otherwise you're in for a great ride.It is very dark, the character development is well made. In 9 episodes you get attached to them.Don't listen to the people discussing the violence, you see worse in Hollywood but without the psychological scenario.There were plenty left for explanation but not in a frustrating way. More of I let the viewer decide. Great addition to the Netflic catalog allover."
395,kanifuker-84708,Not Bad but Not Great Either,5/10,20 September 2021,"It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring.

But other than that this is a masterfully crafted drama by filmmakers who damn well know how to create tension and suspense. I was worried that the ""game"" would turn into a gimmick, but it works so so so well! The acting is also phenomenal, the main characters are portrayed so viscerally human and the ""game"" acts to enrich these characters while making us feel all the thrills! Its damn great stuff!TL;DR: Incredible film making, suspense, tension, great characters and horrible VIP'sLooking forward to Season 2 (if there is one :) !!

I think a good 2 hour movie would have worked just as well; start by cutting out the entire ""VIP"" nonsense. Everything else was so well scripted and designed, how did that part fail so badly? Also, I skipped the entire first 40 minutes of the first episode and lost none of the story. That tells me it was just a time filler. My only other real issue is the captions, which are pretty awful. This appears overall to be a high value production, great costumes, sets, cinematography, why skimp on something as necessary as captioning?

403,mehrdadjg,"Predictable, but Awesome",9/10,27 September 2021,"So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.

405,Holly02,Worth watching,8/10,25 September 2021,"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2."

407,e-jackson1985,Fantastic Show - just let down by 2 eps,8/10,4 October 2021,"Fantastically haunting soundtrack.Rich character development that leads to you having a connection with all of the lead roles.Iconic costumes and a horrifying and thought provoking plot.This should would have gotten a 10 of if wasnt for episodes 7 and 9.(SPOILER ALERT)
X - episode 7 - the VIP's were absolutely horribly cast and they needed a stronger script. I completely understand what they were trying to achieve but literally every line that came out of any of their mouths was cringe worthy in delivery. It took away from an otherwise outstanding episode.X - episode 9 - Everyone loved the relationship of old mate and the lead character. The final ep really took away from that connection. I am a fan of twists but this one just didnt seem believable for me. The character was just too different to be credible.X - red hair was pointless
X - Not getting on the plane felt like a stretch from the leads character. Lets just hope he doesnt go full John Wick in season 2 or its just too far from everything that was great in 7 of the 9 eps.Its hard to give above an 8 when the vips and old mate twist was just one cringe too far.

However, the story is intriguing enough to keep you going and around the middle of the series it really finds its stride. One particular episode is truly heartbreaking and superbly well-shot and acted. Unfortunately, in a needless desire to force a 'shocking twist' into the ending, they up completely undermining that best episode in the show. It really left a sour taste at the end before the final episode just drifts on a bit and ends without much more happening.Overall, glad I watched it but felt the last episode was a enormous let-down.

But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section.

Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.

414,katefrichardson,It's Disturbing...,9/10,13 October 2021,"That the top reviews on this site are because of the VIPs. Let's talk about the show itself.There's a reason this is about to be the number one most watched program on Netflix to date.Netflix has figured out that certain artists need to be recognized for their work... and this one does NOT disappoint.It's a beautiful story really... about life, death, and taxes. The three things that are true in life.It lays itself so deeply between its characters and you feel for each one as it goes along - the character development could be more, but it does the job just fine. It leaves you up to the imagination.The set design is also BRILLIANT.The idea that the games we play as children could be used by ""they"" to kill ""us""... is groundbreaking.Hats off to everyone involved in this. It STRUCK me in the BEST way."
415,Lilith_i,I really tried to like it as much as my friends...,5/10,10 October 2021,"The thing is, for me at least, I had to ""forgive"" much of the script, there are big plot holes in the series that one has to just overlook to make it to the end and give it such high ratings.Don't get me wrong, I get this is not supposed to be taken literally, and some suspension of disbelief is necessary for most syfy series, but you have to be consistent with your own premise.(Side note, sorry if there're mistakes/misspellings, somethings up with my app it seems.)

416,Polotovar,Original idea,9/10,5 October 2021,"There was a new Korean series on Netflix and I didn't really care. But it didn't take long before I started hearing about it from all sides, and only in a good way. So I decided to watch this series and I don't regret it at all. The 1st episode introduced us to the main character, who I thought was awesome. Overall, all the contestants here had something going for them and each character was interesting to me in some way. The 2nd episode was the worst for me. But from the 3rd episode onwards, it picked up the pace and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and it started to get quite suspenseful. As I mentioned, I found every character interesting, so I was always interested to see who would die and how it would all turn out. The games were fun, interesting, and overall the idea of grown people playing children's games seemed original to me. Other than that, as I mentioned I really enjoyed myself and each game had something to it. What also pulled the series for me was the overall interestingness and mystery. There are actually a few unexpected moments. Except for perhaps one thing, I didn't anticipate anything and the series kept surprising me. To sum it all up. I think Ojingeo geim is an amazing series and I recommend it."

420,Airman87,Should have been a 4 episode mini series... Slow at times.,7/10,6 October 2021,"A movie would have been way too short and required some serious character cuts, however 9 episodes was also too long. There were a lot of lull moments that either dragged or unnecessary side stories that contributed very little to the overall story and arc of the protagonists. Had this been sliced down into 4 or 5 episodes, the overall pacing would have been much better and created an overall more intense viewing experience to constantly kept viewers on edge. A little trimming and this would handily have been a solid 10/10 experience at how fervent and enrapturing the story moves.One thing also worth commenting is that Netflix indirectly spoils the final episode. On the parental guidance at the top of the screen, the 'suicide' word appears, ultimately revealing the outcome of the final game (even though it was rather predictable, it does confirm it).Not a bad series and worth watching, just do not watch all 9 episodes in a row or the story may move too slowly. It would be better with some time between episodes so you can build anticipation."
421,BellaMyEmily,Binge watched it in a day,9/10,9 October 2021,"I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I committed a whole day in front of this show but it really caught me. Episode 6 had me bawling my eyes out. However, I feel like the last episode was a little disappointed. They tried to make you understand that you won't find happiness in money, but I just feel like the pace and the vibe were a bit off compared to the rest of the show. And such a shame to learn that the character whose ""death"" you mourned the most showed to be the evil guy all along.

423,visionaforethought,How can this be a 15?,1/10,20 September 2021,"I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,

They are masters at layering dubious qualities on their protagonists, which often makes the lead characters quite unpredictable, yet still very relatable.For too long Western cinema has followed the narrative that the 'good guy' has to be a 'nice guy'.... when in fact, the majority of us look out for our own self interests when push comes to shove.I feel like the writers left a few plot holes here and there.... but overall Squid Game was very entertaining. I gave it a 9/10 despite its shortcomings.

The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start.

440,Nos2001,Oh the moral dilemmas!,8/10,28 September 2021,"With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!"
441,petdavies,Good but couldn't invest in characters,7/10,14 October 2021,"Concept is like a revival of battle royale (loosely) and very brutal. I was watching with an open jaw on episode 1. Slightly deteriorated a tad with each episode.I couldn't invest in any character enough to care. Don't make a second series and let this stand alone as a solid series itself. Like they should've done with a Handmaids Snail.

443,loozzotys,overrated & the ending S01E08 was stupid,4/10,6 October 2021,"Kids may not know it is basically a copy of the Japanese movie ""As the Gods Will"" - the first chapters are identical concepta add then bits of ""Escape Room"" ""The Cube"" and the ultraviolence of ""A clockwork Orange"" (btw the VIP lounge scene is obviously idea taken from the Clockwork Orange movie's ""Milk Bar"" scene).Also the English subtitles are awful.The ending was so disappointing. And the last episode was half as long! Underwhelming.

Its the best series i have seen in a very very long time but i do feel it will be a one hit wonder. A season 2 just wont be able to match up to the buzz & excitement surrounding Season 1.

But overally a very good show. The only thing I found that it's very slow.Shows every aspect of humans in a good fictional ways how each one betrays or kills or uses others for own survival. And the last episode where he tells how you bet on horses we on humans, shows the power of hierarchy. A very well written story as always I've seen other works of the director and he never disappoints badly.

449,amongthylacines,What Hollywood forgot,9/10,22 September 2021,"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended."
450,dummy-79,Good But 2 Episodes Too Long,7/10,26 September 2021,"Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean's. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3's innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing.

I almost NEVER rewatch any show, and this is the first time I've ever watched a live action foreign show.

The show has it's flaws, but by far one of the best shows I've ever seen.

454,kellen-couzens,Fizzles out mid way,5/10,27 September 2021,"STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.

461,bougiadaa,Intresting BUT just okay,6/10,10 October 2021,"SQUID GAME is a series with a lot of common with HUNGER GAMES
in other words it is like hunger game with more fantastic and weird challenges ..The thing that Iliked was the message that it offers''Money do not bring happiness'' and that people can kill their friend for the sake of money
it has an intresting plot and actor's performances are good too
i was also burst into tears in ep 6BUT there are some disadvantages that should be taken into account ...such as there are tooo many violence scenes that should not exist in my opinion and some plotwist that i had already expected them .The issue with the policeman at the begging was intresting and i thought that he may help competitors to escape but he did not do something important to the plot , he could not to exist or be somehow different.Finally it has a weak ending .. it could be better .To my mind there are such a lot masterpiece of Korean industry and this one is not one of them but i reccomend it to everyone to watch it."
462,asdfqaz123,Only possible outside of Hollywood,10/10,30 September 2021,"This is the bravest, most intelligent show I've seen in years, absolutely blown away by the thoughtfulness in the script. There's so many layers in the script, one has to be a parent/son/bread winner/unemployed to truly appreciate the full depth of it.The first layer it puts down is the modern slavery that's known as debt. It uses the the Korean household debt crisis as the backdrop rather than some made up excuse like a sci-fi film. This makes watching the series so much more relatable.Another layer worth mentioning is the father saying goodbye to his daughter. The depiction was realistic and poignant, none of the overacting typically seen in a Hollywood film. I personally felt the pain for the father.The fact that characters can act according to their free will adds another layer to the plot. Ultimately, this series is about the ugly side of human nature. Nobody forces us to do anything but when push comes to shove, it often brings out the worst of us, a side that we never knew existed.Overall, I feel this series is deep and thought provoking. It blends real social issues with fantasy thrills without going overboard. Though we may not have survival games like these in the real world, it is still quite true that debt can make a person vulnerable. So, spare a thought for someone around you who's in financial needs and offer them some help. I think that's the message from the filmmakers."

464,iSeeMoView,Was set up to...FAIL,7/10,11 October 2021,"This series would deserve a solid 9, except for the fact that's it contains 3 pathetic and unacceptable flaws.As high-caliber that each episode and the storyline was, it went majorly downhill in Episode 7 with the portrayal of the VIPs. The show's portrayal of idiotic Americans takes the viewer right down to an uncomfortable level at how ridiculously these characters were expected to be. Even if they were attempting to make them seem stupid, it made the show pretty cringe-worthy from how well it had developed up until that point. It quickly went downhill at the introduction of these characters.Finally, the ending of the final ""game"" played in the show was really dumb and lacked redemption in the characters' development. As well as, the ending of the film and it's dialogue leading up to it.I was going to knock off 3 points for the above 3 mentioned failures, but wanted to be generous with a final rating if 7 (reduced from what could have been a 9, had they not messed up this show so badly). Overall, the show was excellent - until it was not - with its horrible conclusion.As good as this show was for most of it, the ending completely destroyed it, making me wonder ""What was the point of watching this?"" It is unbelievable that a show that was written and acted so well, turned into something sloppy at the end that could have been written much better. It's as if someone different who had no idea what the story was, wrote the final episode.I recommend watching it for 85% of the show. If you're not attached to having a properly explainable and redemptive ending, then you may love the whole thing."

467,katharina-muellner,Not a new idea,7/10,10 October 2021,"An enjoyable watch, but personally I liked Alice in Borderland from last year better. Very similar idea, but more interesting games and characters.In squid game nothing really unexpected happened.And the dinner in the end reminded me very much of hunger games- which as well has more or less the same story.But all together still very solid an a 7 for me.

468,RMBittner-777-930003,OTT Acting Spoils Intriguing Story,5/10,4 October 2021,"Maybe ""Train to Busan"" spoiled me with its naturalistic performances, but this series seems proud of characters that scream every line and act so over-the-top and hammy that it's ridiculous. I've sampled both the original Korean version as well as the English dubbed version, and both are equally guilty. Some of the leads are better than others, of course, but the hams overshadow them, making this feel oddly amateurish in places.

469,whiskeymovie,Could have been an 8 or 9,6/10,27 September 2021,"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.

470,naifkhulaifi,Squid game best show in 2021?,10/10,26 September 2021,"First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.

471,ppde,Complete dark series. And no one would talk about it,7/10,6 October 2021,"Season 1 rated 8. 7 if they make another.This series expresses an aspect of Korean movie culture, which wants to show people in their worst poor helpless stateA recent Korean movie got so famous, and it showed how people live in home of others without getting detected. Similar kind of movies are something that Korean society seems to enjoy. Watch the destituteness helplessness of urban poor. It is not the VIPs that are making this game play and them enjoying it. It the well feed society of Korea that wants to enjoy others with lesser means of survival in our present capitalistic society getting ripped off the basic necessities for living. America has done it's part of making a society completely opposite of communist North. Completely filled with big shopping heaven, richness, laviousness, go to place to have plastic surgeries, so and soAsk yourself, what society would it be where large crowd would gather in a colosseum to watch gladiators killing each others right in front. People killing each other, getting killed and there it just one survivor. How cruel it is.Series showed that this game is played for many decades.. Seriously.. no flaws in it? Wasn't there Korean Bruce Lee or Rambo to save the day? All this years and no one detected it? Every year 455 dying on this earth and police didn't know or attempted to catch them?Rule of the game is if anyone wants to quit the game they will be eliminated. So don't people should know that elimination means being killed? It's only after round 1 does people know about it. Rules should be in essence clear and not be coded or with a duel meaning. Rule of rules is not followed. Round 1 was with so many unnecessary killings.One day before I read in news of best and topmost reputation from UK, that this series is getting more and more liked across nations. But there main topic in the news was that the English subtitles are not doing good justice to the excellent Korean dialogue. Again seriously.. Why would a English knower will be bothered about minor translation loss or miscommunication. We are watching it more then actually reading subtitles line by line. Many Korean who knows English well enough have to say this about subtitles. How will it affect? By getting better appreciation? Answer from me is no!Apart from it, the best thing is the setup of the games and the rooms. It seems that set production was one excellent piece of work. Perfection in the making feel that that's where a game should be played. The colors the dresser the clean act except of course by VIPs.I enjoyed the series but I am sorry, the meaning of Korean movie culture shows an aspect that is darker then one may think."
472,maddyschiappa,Such a wild ride! Ending left me unsatisfied,9/10,5 October 2021,"Things I LOVED: the music, the cinematography, the writing, the story, the metaphors. It was really good!Things that I didn't love: the ending, the actors playing the VIPs (so bad in comparison to the main characters that it watered down the other actors' performances) and the hand feeding of things that we are supposed to remember. The fun is realizing you remember on your own!I still recommend watching obviously!

473,labamboos,Never Let Perfect Get in the way of Great Cult Classic,9/10,3 October 2021,"This was a great reminder as to how concept can trump acting and writing. Even with some of the questionable choices of some performers, this show stands on its concept - which, though not new, is executed excellently. One of those that will likely be adapted for a western audience in the future. Solid watch, if you are not distracted by the more dodgy parts, and definitely better than a lot of other shows in the same genre at the moment. Cult classic methinks.

474,tatjanabollen,Great untill episode 4,6/10,29 September 2021,"The show started of great, but after episode 4 it went downhill really fast. In the last episodes i was allmost confused if i was watching a Korean serie or a Mexican telenovel. Don't even get me started with rhe vips. And the agent looking for his brother was a bit to obvious for me who his brother turned out to be. As well as the old man and his death. A possible great show got crinchy and predictable the last episodes.

475,nakeita-28697,A good show with plenty more potential,7/10,2 October 2021,"I went into the show with high expectations purely because of how hyped it has been in the media recently and honestly.. it's good. Not incredible like the media is playing it out to be but for its genre it's probably one of the best I've seen.I like the concept of this show, definitely reminds me of the hunger games.. all fighting over something with a common goal and everything just happens to fall in to place.. there's a lot of shows/movies like it but at the same time none quite like this one...Unlike most shows that fall in the same category I don't feel like this was too dragged out in anyway, everything had perfect timing and everything added to the plot nicely, it wasn't too repetitive and it continued to surprise me, it had many unexpected events that I honestly highly enjoyed.At first I wasn't quite sure how to feel about the ending.. a second season? Normally shows plummet when there is a forced second season but at the same time I'm glad there wasn't just some bland happy ending. Im excited to see how the second season pans out and I'll definitely be watching."
476,Jinki-ache,"Good show, but I prefer Alice in Borderland",8/10,23 September 2021,"I liked Squid Game, it's refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can't act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB.

Three stabs, one to the leg, one to the stomach and another one right through his hand, and he is still standing and fighting, while one bite on the ankle, and the other guy is done, what the hell?The cop and his frontman brother, what was that about? Extremely irrelevant and added absolutely nothing to the story, just what was the whole point of it except just wasting time?And don't get me started with the VIP's, just duh....Long story short, watch the hunger games....

There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don't waste your time.

I watched it with the English dub (this is something you forget about by episode 2), I don't care what you say, I enjoyed it just as much as I would subtitles. Great acting, awesome writing, very, very cool concept. I also don't buy the narrative everyone's barking about the bad VIP acting. They were likely casted to be unintelligent and rather elementary. This was actually cool to me because it made me think not everyone in power is smart and ""scripted"". This was the least of my concerns. Really enjoyed this one!

I like to think I cry at things when it's needed but I'm either going though something subconsciously right now or this series just got me ... got me bad... I blubbered at without a doubt the most heartbreaking episode ( 6) I've ever witnessed from a show .

489,Sippyteacups,The best one of these in a long time ...,9/10,23 September 2021,"This is the best ""Death Game"" / ""Battle Royal"" type of show I've seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What's usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It's the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows ""aliens"" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That's not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that's really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there's a group of people that you'll encounter and they are horribly acted. You'll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future."

Good idea but poorly executed, the series has some flashes of brilliance but is overrall weighed down by the poor dramatization. Discussing the VIPs is a waste of time.

Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass.

499,slowdive23-1,Ignore the Naysayers,10/10,7 October 2021,"It's pretty unreal how shallow-minded many of the reviewers are here. They are griping about the acting. It's nothing short of brilliant, and very much representative of the Korean style. If those people watched Old Boy or Parasite, they would immediately realize the strength and potency of it, and how it plays well into the dimensions of the characters and the plot threads that surround them.The sudden outbursts and taciturn restraint from the main and side characters are a mixture of subtlety and overreaching. It's a delightful balance here. It's also refreshing to see this instead of the atrociously mundane acting, like say in Clickbait where the actors are overly restrained so they can look attractive for the camera.This series is immensely intriguing. Listen closely for the nuances of emotion even behind the masks. Kudos to the producers and writers for being bold and for - after ten years - getting this series put onto the small screen for us to relish in with giddy delight thanks to their tenacity with Netflix."
500,jhonculada,Very bingeworthy!,8/10,24 September 2021,"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.

504,victorson-1,What a complete waste of time,1/10,11 October 2021,"This is everything wrong with modern film-making. The whole thing lacks any logical sense, it drags on for way too long, the games are moronic and unimaginative, the characters are shallow, there is not even an attempt at creating some nuance and emotion, I would have more compassion watching chicken die than this absolutely ridiculous man-slaughter. The main character is this completely unremarkable John battered by life that only occasionally yells angrily at the world. All of it is just one huge waste. If you get a thrill of seeing people dye on screen for no reason, all decorated in ridiculous settings and surrounded with PlayStation-like mask people, go for it though. It's literally that, nothing more.

507,cile-chan,SAE BYEOK... I WILL NEVER GET OVER,8/10,28 September 2021,"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.

Why that hell were the 'supposedly good guys' feeling sorry for themselves when they voluntarily rejoined the games - the killings, deaths were inevitable but the main guy still wanted the moral high ground. Just a poor, very disturbing show, why all the grotesque violence and poor ending, the main character only went back for the money he knew in order to win others have to die. But now he doesnt want to use the money and is annoyed at the killings. You cant have it both ways mate!!!.

509,hammy-38359,Perhaps a good show ruined in translation?,5/10,4 October 2021,"Just read a review from a Korean speaker who says the translation of the dialogue is poor to say the least. That was one of biggest problems with this show. The English dialogue is awful. Painful.The acting is ok but there does tend to be a lot of stage, exaggerated acting in front of the camera. It is over the top. In particular from one of the central, female characters. The ""baddie"" just does stereotypical baddie.Central story is fine. Interesting at times. Sets are very good. Didn't like the ending. Don't why the writer thought that would be a better ending than just the winner's game comes to an end and then he witnesses the beginning of the next one.An alright show in my opinion but don't understand the hype.

512,SamuelJan03,A Very Entertaining and Binge-able TV Series,10/10,3 October 2021,"This TV series is so good I think mainly because it is relatable. I believe anyone who watches this will unconsciously put themselves in the situation of the players in the game. One of the reason it is also relatable is because the personalities of each character is different, consequently their approach to the game. Apart from that, mostly the emotions from watching this series will make you engage at every moment making you hooked at it.

513,Angerforz,Overall a great show!,7/10,29 September 2021,"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.

518,milart-08581,This was really cool,7/10,5 October 2021,"I wasn't experting a lot from this series, because movies/series that are this hyped are not usually the best. But this was great!! First of al the idea was awsome and the achting was exeptional, exept for the awful VIP's (but i loved the masks they where wearing) The set design is som of the best i have ever seen in any movie/series. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 9 is the ending. I won't go into it, but it is not at all what i was hoping for. I also love that Netflix is investing in foreign cinema, and the risk that they took was absolutely worth it!So i absolutely recomend this te everyone who can handle a little blood.PS: sorry for the bad english, I'm dutch so you know.....

It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It.

From gaming the system, to playing the system, and being played by the system. Is all Korean in the representation of those ideas after that. After watching a couple of Old Boy(s) sort of movies, the thriller of plot turns and the display of certain characters seem too repetitive.Nevertheless, it is well-made. And it has the potential of becoming the best show worldwide if they iinternationalize it. There are kids' games in my country that have the potential of being far more brutal with the proper setting.Bit is atrociius writing this revuew in Android.

524,summer_rain000,"Yes, like it!",9/10,23 September 2021,"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:
some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun fact
The main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam.

I think.The acting is appalling, especially Gi-hun or whatever his name is whose only quality is to overcome his own stupidity when one already thinks that's impossible ... I would never tire of hammering his face.It's easily in the top 5 of the worst series I've ever seen. Lost 9 hours of my life to this rubbish, just to understand why people like it...even failed at that
I prefer to sit in in a park and watch the grass grow ... much more satisfying and entertaining.

528,shahe-512-458330,Failed to meet my expectations,4/10,7 October 2021,"4stars. Hardly!I had high expectations before watching Squid Games... but it let me down.I am a fan of foreign and independent productions, never had the chance to watch from South Korea though.It starts off pretty well, but fails to keep the flame up with each following episode...
No spoilers ahead!In my humble opinion, if I want to rate the series in different aspects it will be as follows - the points are over 10.1- Acting: mediocre - 2
2- Story line: too predictable and highly unnecessary scenes - 4
3- cinematography: nothing new - 3
4- Music : boring -2
5- Length: Horribly long and boring durations of episodes (my wife and I usually do not use our smart phones while we watch a series... unfortunately we were constantly checking our phones...) - 3
6- Concept: very nice and new but with bad execution - 5
7- Production: average - 5
8-Ending: it does not end... please roll the credits!!! But you still watch... hehe! - 2 (and the red hair was a total turn off)
9- message: at least horses don't violently die in betting games."

530,gotjee_arts,Glossy Fare For Torture Aficionados,2/10,21 September 2021,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people."
531,CarlosFacundoCornejo,I don't want to spoil you this great series,9/10,7 October 2021,"But the main takeaway from this series is never trust an old man. Besides that, there are lot of bad human habits exposed of course, and also unexpected situations that made this a solid nine for me, some things could have been better (i.e. The main character old friend is way too sadistic in most of the cases) but is truly a footage of the human being in the world.

532,mjking1992,Good television that could have been great,7/10,5 October 2021,"A deeply poignant show that superbly builds its critique of our current economic system and the despair and utter desperation that it drives people to, particularly in the second episode. The acting is powerful and the characters also possess strong identities so you quickly come to see them as people.Unfortunately, the show peaks in the sixth episode, which was phenomenal and some of the best television I have seen. From then on, however, the quality declines, important subplots are left with no resolution, and the ending was erratic and dissatisfying: for example, it does not touch on previous themes of democracy and equality in the process.It feels as though the original script was heavily edited so as to allow a second season, and therefore make more money. Ironic in a critique of capitalism, but there you are.Overall, still worth watching."

534,Stan72317,Watchable but overrated.,7/10,29 September 2021,"Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie ""Would you Rather"". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work.

535,Roogatsby,there is no such thing as mine or yours gganbu,10/10,27 September 2021,"Hello English-ish friends!(Tl;dr: Skip the subs & switch to dubs.)This sensational series will probably appeal to you if you like cerebral, violent critiques of capitalism bolstered by strong character development (i.e. The Belko Experiment, the Cube films, Exam, Fermat's Room, or the Danganronpa video game series)...I watched the first episode in Korean but something is wrong with the translation in the subtitles. This became more apparent when I switched over to the English dub but left the subs on - the dub is much more nuanced, and the voice actors do a great job ad-libbing to match the characters mouths. Really excellent sound editing overall. If you don't watch a lot of anime or foreign dubs this might be a jarring experience (along with the English-speaking VIPs who are unfairly criticized in the reviews here) ..but I encourage you to stick with it becauseSquid Game is a lot of twisted fun!"

540,allthevines,Great until the latter part of the season,7/10,3 October 2021,"The series is great and worth the watch. I have to admit I already called the twist by the second episode, but the journey was great. The latter part of the season lost its way with some heavy cringe characters but I'll look past that. My biggest gripe comes with the latter part becoming cliché and in violation of what previous episodes had laid down, as in everyone has a fair shot at winning whereas the game they played was in gross violation of that (episode 7). Give it a watch though.

541,joana98,very average,6/10,6 October 2021,"If you have nothing else to do then give it a try.The characters are a cliche, the story is the same old good evil greed narrative, the concept is ok and the cop-brother storyline is just boring.It reminded me of Gantz! They could have added some elements from the anime and make it better. It would have been a good mix.Overall, 6/10.Take your popcorn, your drinks, your chicken wings and enjoy.

542,eleester,It was good...for a while,6/10,22 September 2021,"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.

545,marydanza,You would anything for money,8/10,8 October 2021,"""Squid Game"" is certainly a metaphor of our time: in order to achieve financial independence people are ready to sell their soul to get it.The funny thing is that the winner is actually the only player who seems to have kept a system of human values. The meanness of each person looks concealed but as soon as the series picks up the pace it is irrefutably showed.The acting was authentic and believable but the so called plot twist could have hit harder.

547,moviepiglet,"Very entertaining show, but nothing spectacular",7/10,5 October 2021,"Yes the show was super entertaining and had you engrossed, and might even go on to become Netflix's most watched show, but for viewers who have seen enough cinema, there was nothing ground breaking here.The overall plot about rich people being bored so using poor people for entertainment - that's been done. The final revelation the old man gave was quite cliched.What was the point of the entire sub plot with the cop looking for his brother? He turns out to be the main guard, but so what? That seemed quite a pointless chase.Half the games were quite boring to be honest.As enough people have mentioned here, the VIPs were a shocker. It was quite expected that the games were being funded by a crew of rich bored people for entertainment, but those actors and their dialogue gets a 0/10.Still, the show had great acting and fun characters, but the plot could have been WAY tighter.

548,beyzafififi,"impressive, dramatic and traumatic!!",8/10,7 October 2021,"Although there were logic errors and nonsense, the series was very gripping and did not lose its grip by making it interesting until the end. It was a quality production in general, but the ending was so unnecessary and ridiculous. Despite its shortcomings, it is an impressive series with its characters, drama and reaction. Especially the first game, ""red light, green light"", terrified the audience beautifully and reflected the traumaticity and drama, which is the theme of the series. Also, the series has been the voice of people suffering from economic difficulties. The things I love about the show are the characters, the good portrayal of emotions in the scenes, and the beautiful creative plot. So i love this show in general, i can give from 7,5/10 to 8/10. By the way, those VIP guys acting were sucks dude, i felt so cringe when they talk.. but in general, they all were good actors and actresses i think.

549,yes_jessica,Great show!,8/10,4 October 2021,"Although this serie is definitely not perfect I loved it! Interesting concept and loved the games. I would have rated this higher based on my favorite scenes: the first 3 games and the main characters were perfect! But some parts ruined a higher score: The VIPS were terrible, the story of the police officer did not add that much and I did not like the glass game. But overall: go watch this.

550,redbullrex,The acting!,8/10,13 October 2021,"I binged it so currently I don't have much to say about it. I must watch it at least one more time. But as of right now I give this a 8/10. The acting was amazing. I didn't understand a single word but I could still feel everything they were saying, american actors can't come close to this type of acting so I highly recommend watching it in Korean. I tried the dubbed version for fun and it was horrible. It felt kinda rushed, really intense for the most part but then it had this sudden drop that lasted for one and a half hour and it dosen't leave a big impact on you afterwards. I don't know what they plan on doing in the future but I guess I'm just not used to TV shows being so rushed right away.

554,diarkosophy,"Yes, Yes and More Yes",10/10,29 September 2021,"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?"
555,jasonsgk,A little overhyped but decent,7/10,6 October 2021,"It's a good series. Is it as good as Alice in Borderland, not really, this one, while having more realistic qualities, is basically that series meets Parasite with a light flavoring of Saw series. Outside of the main character there isn't much in the way of an engaging cast. In fact towards the end of the series you're rooting against most of them. The side story was particularly laboring and disengaging. The theming is little too blatant and bordering on sophomoric. It's really just not that clever, despite the hype. It is a good series, and of course being a K series social and economic injustice is deeply threaded into the theme. Like I said though, it's enjoyable, worth the watch but not as thoughtful as it tries so hard to be.

556,rockyislolicon,Great start but dissapointed ending,6/10,21 September 2021,"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.

The only only criticism is that the VIP's acting was awful and I hope if a 2nd series is made they get rid of the English speaking actors. I've also watched Alice in Borderland which was good but this is better and more interesting. I would recommend this series and hope there is a second. If you enjoyed this, watch Battle Royale the ""Hunger games"" superior original.

I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc.

567,josechr,Worth your time,7/10,8 October 2021,"""Squid game"" is a Korean mystery/thriller tv-series about a group of people selected to participate in a sinister game of survival.Every participant is selected because they are out of luck and in debt, and desperate enough to do what it takes to escape their fate in the outside world.We follow deadbeat dad and gambling addict Seong Gi-Hun, as he continue to fall into bottomless debt, and after a fateful late night gamble at the subway, gets an invitation to a final game where everything will change.What follows is a series of games, where the stakes are final if you lose, but the price is a chance to redeem yourself financially and for some, morally.The show is really nothing more, or less, than a solid script, with no forced finger pointing or animosity based on race or sex. There are assholes and villains, and there are good people, and people in between. Regardless of gender, race or sexual orientation. There's no bigotry outside of that, which U. S. TV-shows are unable to write or make anymore.It's exciting, but there is a certain amount of over-acting and a bit of melodrama that can be somewhat grating to a western palate, but when the script is that good and engaging, it's easy enough to stomach. Other than the aforemented, the actors do a stellar job.It has some flaws of course. It's not groundbreaking or terribly original in it's constituant parts, but as a whole, it works perfectly fine for what it is.It's well shot, well paced, engaging, but with some overplaying that draws you out of the story a bit, as mentioned. Overall an enjoyable, exciting and somewhat gory and bloody good series, with added societal criticism and a message that doesn't label any specific demographic as inherently evil."
568,vitnamee,Binge Worthy battle royale / hunger games in modern day Korea.,8/10,20 September 2021,"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again.

569,cooverknight,A fantasy story told many times before and with less obvious plot points.,4/10,10 October 2021,"I read a short story 'The Most Dangerous Game' in high school with basically the same plot, but not sci-fi with special effects. I found the Squid Game super boring and just about every plot point was predictable. I think the average Superman comic book has more interesting twists than this overblown, stretched out story. It was a disappointment since there are a lot of Asian movies and series that have really interesting stories with characters that are more complex than video game ones. But if you like video games, there's a good chance you will like this movie, except that you have no control over the story. Now, if the producers could get the audience involved in determining the fate of the games, that could be interesting. As it is, it's hardly worth spending time writing about it (unless you're getting paid) and I""m not.

I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately.

592,PaulJosephWatson,"Oh Korea, you've gone and done it now!",10/10,28 September 2021,"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading."

594,rtsdynamite,Early Second Season Syndrome,8/10,2 October 2021,"A great narrative/concept which thrills the life out of any audience member. Despite Gi Sung being the primary protagonist there was always doubt in him due to the incompetence he had previously displayed. I genuinely thought Sang Woo would win as he showcased what a 'normal' person would do to live yet still related to us early on. In the games you would want to be Sang Woo, he is the most intelligent and is physically capable of passing the games and so you try to defend his choices until they devour you, similarly seen before with Walter White.However i do have a few issues with Squid Game.1. So the old man was behind it but wanted to get the thrill of playing. I jokingly guessed this as it seemed quite ridiculous. In the tug of war game he was inches away from dying but in the marble game where he actually lost, he lived anyway so the ""thrill"" he was talking about mustve been pretty pointless if he still had control.2. The detective sub plot is intriguing but the reveal is obvious and well... we don't exactly get closure as hes shot in the shoulder, oh... and he fell in water. He'll be perfectly fine for season 2 then.3. Gi Sung goes back to the games, abandoning his daughter and his character arc completion because he wants to know whos behind it? I thought we had concluded that it were just rich sociopaths who had no faith in humanity. I dont see how Gi Sung can gain anything from going back other than a 2nd season.I could praise the show for a while as the positives largely outweigh the negatives, i just thought i'd support the devil's advocate by asking questions that were being overlooked.8/10 Superb acting (the VIP's excluded), plot not as deep as you think.

598,cameronwhiteboy,Should have been a movie,3/10,2 October 2021,"This show drags. I beg of you to skip episode two altogether.We're here to watch the people play the games and die. I don't care about all of these absolute whiny little girls and their annoying problems.I'll admit, I'm watching with English dubs. It's just like anime. It sounds over-acted and annoying. All the women in this show sounds beyond annoying.This show shines when it focuses on the games and the storytelling slightly before and after the games. Everything else is drawn out. I wonder if it's because it's a tv show. A movie would have gotten all of this out of the way and then play ball!There are some great diamonds hidden under an abundance of rocks. If you can hold out, then you can enjoy some great scenes. If you have zero patience though, do yourself a favour and hope they make a movie version."

608,twwarrior,Good show,8/10,1 October 2021,"I think it deserves my rating of 8/10. I think the main reason that I liked it was it made me care about the characters and what happens to them.Some things made no sense though. For example, why would 456 (and others) keep assuming that it's possible to win the game together with someone else? Everytime he was like ""we're gonna get out together"" I got confused as to why he thought more than 1 would survive.Another thing that I thought was stupid was at the end of the glass game, the girl (one of the last three) was injured by the glass shard. It just made no sense to me to do the exploding thing and potentially ruin the last game. But I guess they had to figure out a way to get rid of her so that the 2 men can have a 1 on 1.There's more weird things like that but I guess it doesn't make a huge difference to most people.Definitely worth a watch though.

612,coeluracat,Not very Original,6/10,14 October 2021,"As per my title this isn't a very original idea. It's been done time and time again: Highlander (1986), Battle Royale (2000), The Hunger Games (2012), Animal World (2018) etc. The only difference is the venue/place where they are held and the winnings at the end.I tried to watch this when it first appeared on Netflix, but after 3 episodes it still hadn't impressed me, and was quickly forgotten when I found something better to binge watch. After seeing all the hype about it I decided to give it another go, perhaps I should have given it 4 episodes? Nope it still didn't impress.I have to question the '111 million fans' claim by Netflix. I'm more inclined to believe it is 111 million 'Viewings' that include the multiple viewings by single individuals or their group friends at home or around at their friends houses when their parents are away. Viewings do not correspond to fans.The acting is your usual frenetic Korean overacting, overdone facial expressions combined with family honour/disappointment.The main characters, although given back stories, aren't what you would consider likeable so you don't really invest too much empathy into who will or won't survive, bearing in mind that 'There can be only one' (to quote Highlander) winner at the end of the game.My only real interest was in working out who was behind the whole setup of 'Squid Game' and who the 'Frontman' was. The clues are there and it didn't take me too long to have a (correct) working theory.I suppose if you are looking for some 'bloody' entertainment, that you can disengage your brain to watch, then this will meet your needs.I gave it a generous 6 stars as while it isn't as good as it is hyped to be it certainly isn't as bad as some of Netflix's underwhelming prior offerings."
613,sebastian-lim,The Hunger Games meet The Platform,9/10,1 October 2021,"First and foremost, a big round of applause for the director 👏👏👏 This is by far the darkest and most 'un-korean', edgiest Korean TV series I've watched to date.There isn't the typical sponsored usage of Samsungs, Mercedes, Subway, McDonald's or any of the big names that one would catch in a typical Korean TV series.It's grippingly leaves you at the edge of your seat craving for the next episode and the next.A must watch and absolutely loved the idea of the series.

615,paddymcrico,K-Drama that has shocked the West,9/10,24 September 2021,"This is the first Korean Series I have ever watched and I am glad I gave it ago.Lee Jung-jae (Seong Gi-hun #456) made this show for me. Given the fact he is the main character given the responsibility of capturing the audience during the initial introduction, he gave an amazing performance throughout the series.The show itself is a nice mix a gripponh dramatic thriller but with a slightly comedic element that wasn't forced. I liked the way you got a sense of background for each of the main characters. No doubt the costumes and symbolism is going to be iconic. So credit to Hwang Dong-hyuk for coming up with this concept.I think the performance of Anupam Tripathi (Abdul Ali #199) should also be commended. For a Korean Series to achieve such diversity in a show was great and he played his role to a tee.So all in all well played Korea and your spot at the top of many charts is quite an achievement. I gave it an IMDb 9, however really its a 10/10 from me."

619,Ben_Schwartz_,Binge Worthy,7/10,12 October 2021,"So hard to stop watching this crazy stupid show. Got to give it to the writers, it was so addictively captivating.Set design was so good you'll be seeing every halloween costume this year look the same.Episode 6 was by the far the peak of this series, an unbelievable conclusion to the previous 5 episodes. After that however, I can't say much... seemed to drift from the theme of fairness and equity among players which I really liked.Definitely recommend this series. Even though some of the mysteries that were trying to be sneaky were quite apparent early on, it didn't take away from the excitement and stakes of the game.(And something that I knew bothered many people was the atrocious acting by the American characters. Not sure if the problem was poor casting choices or some kind of language barrier, but damn, I can safely say for everyone- that part was hard to watch)"
620,travismancour,Is this the start of the Death Game popularity?,7/10,2 October 2021,"From some of the Manga Death games I've read Squid game is a decent port of the idea to the big screen done in this fashion. Sounds like its popular enough on Netflix that we will probably see copy cats soon (Maybe even a non-death version like Liars Game could be on the table now). As for the show itself I found it lacking in some parts, also didn't like most of the participants except the old man who was the standout. I found only about 2 of the games interesting.

633,MsAce,VIPs from The Masked Singer Cannot Act,7/10,14 October 2021,"It's an interesting concept for sure. But the scene where the VIPs arrived looking like they were ready to perform in The Masked Singer is just so dumb.Plus rows of identical cars boarding a ferry at night seems like the kind of thing that would get flagged as suspicious.And the cop not calling for backup? Running directly in the line of sight of the rear view mirror. A game that has been going on for years and yet no security at the gates. Choosing to go at it alone. Risking it all for his 1 kidney brother. That's just senseless.Evading the armed troops in a labyrinth littered with cameras is also senseless.I felt like the revelation of the anarchy rule in the dorms was a bit rushed. A small guy attacking a thug with a freaking face tattoo while he was with his group of thugs is something that I do not see happening. Then the small guy dying so quickly.Given that you can just kill each other in the dorm, Deok-su could have killed Mi-nyeo with his bare hands but he didn't.Back to the VIPs. They are my main gripe. The awful script. Goodness gracious. I had to pause every few lines because it was just abysmal.I thought the painted naked people were unnecessary.All that aside I did enjoy the show overall. The games were simple yet creative. And I always love a good tug of war.I thought they did good by restarting the contest with those who chose to come back eyes wide open. You feel less for them since they chose their own destiny.The story was also insightful. The portrayal of gambling addiction. Predatory lending in South Korea. The concept of throwing good money at bad and going for broke. Chasing the ever elusive dream of winning big money. I also liked how they covered the topic of religious hypocrisy.I loved the characters they created.Massive spoilers below.It was obvious who the stronger guy was. He is also exponentially smarter. Yet somehow at the end he was a flailing idiot who could not anticipate obvious moves from the offensive and instead just attacking widly. Makes no sense.It was a bit too obvious who the finalists would be.And it was a bit obvious that the old man was in on it when they did not show his death. Tried a bit too hard to be poetic at the end.But Gi-hun coming out looking like freaking Party Poison at the end was hilarious.The fact that he took the kid and just gave him to the old woman was such a typical useless dad thing to do.Leaving his mother without a caretaker, is a typical useless son thing to do. Always with the grand noble intentions. Far too little, far too late.Then turning his back on his daughter, is really typical also.If you are a bad son, and a bad father, all the money in the world cannot change that. Just because you are not evil does not mean that you are a good person.

637,kowstoff,"Predictable plot, and not original.",4/10,13 October 2021,"I don't get the hype for this show, honestly. It's very predictable, and it doesn't feel original. I just feel like I was watching one of the ''Saw'' movies. However, I like the idea behind the show in an apparent criticism of capitalism society and billionaires in general. It can be a very tough reality to confront, but this show portraits the bad side of capitalism in a very depressing and violent way, as it should be.On the other hand, it's not that hard to criticize capitalism, it's actually a very easy target. It's almost a trend these days, with all other TV shows and movies addressing this topic. I'm not saying it is bad to address this topic at all. I'm really glad this is being discussed, I just feel that this topic isn't enough to make this show original or surprising in any aspect. It's surely not a virtue of this show.Squid Game tries to build tension on violence and death, just like GOT did. But GOT's tension is genuine, well-built, and really unpredictable (unless you read the books). The tension here is almost useless, since we all know how this is going to end, and the characters death become almost trivial throughout the show. We know who will likely win and who won't. Sure, there are some surprises/plot twists along the way regarding the characters, but it's not that mind-blowing anyway.Violence scenes are excellent! It's raw, straightforward and merciless. I also liked the cliffhanger in the end. I like how the main character wasn't conformed with all the violent events, and how he evolved to a more mature and dangerous person.The first season of Squid Game didn't impress me, but there's room to improve in possible future seasons. This show needs another season, not only because of the cliffhanger, but the narrative needs a better outcome, and the main character deserves a better legacy.

640,yoshiduyen,Worthy binge!,10/10,17 September 2021,"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres."
641,brandonabrajano,Netflix has a winner,9/10,1 October 2021,"I love this show and the popularity is well-deserved. I was on the edge of my seat ever since the first game and it never let up, even in the outside world. Love all of the characters despite their cynicism and love each of the games and how original yet familiar they feel. There's also this lurking tension as to who will live, who will die, and who is behind all of this. Overall, worth your time and I understand if you don't like the final twists, but personally, it had me glued to the screen.

651,zippo8,NO ARTISTIC INTEGRITY SO LOSES ALL POINTS,1/10,9 October 2021,"Hey Hwang Dong-Hyuk you can't have it both ways!!This is the real world, this is real people being selected from the real world to enter a surreal world to play a game fabricated by real people who pay a lot of money to be entertained.The final demonstration of this unarguable truth is when 456 - a real flesh and blood human remember on planet earth - decides he is going to take a stand, be a whistleblower, and bring the whole grotesque vileness tumbling down.That's all fine BUT ...there is one episode where the real world crosses over into the surreal world of Squid Game, and that is when the VIPs come to town.This would have been a very difficult episode to pull off using ""real people"", think about that for a minute, the all too close to home, close up ugliness of it, so the director WIMPS OUT and we do not get ""real people"", we get an arm's length absurdist parody of the repulsive rich, a staged nonsense drawn from the director's imagination to replace that which was just too damned difficult to make real.Nuh! That's not ok.Hence so many people here complaining about the VIPS poor acting. But it not POOR ACTING that is the problem, the elephant in the room is the sleight of hand and dishonest depiction of the VIPS full stop.You can't do that, and maintain a unified aesthetic, artistic integrity.Make an MC Escher style world full of every kind of fantasy and excess by all means, knock yourself out, but don't ALSO bring the real world - the real world THAT IS ACTUALLY RUNNING THE SHOW inside and turn it into masked comedy.You'd have been better off keeping observers off the premises altogether, shadowy mysterious figures watching from afar via technology.THAT would have been REAL... and may I say, a lot more spooky.Overall, I'm truly amazed at the plaudits for this show, the raving, the buzz, the wow!!! The omggggs!!! The attention on SM....yes it is bingeable, it is easily addictive, and there are some great performances too, but I honestly think COVID has left the community desperate for distraction for people to be responding to this as they are.Bit sad really.Can only give this one star, because as the old saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

652,weatherladykatie,Hard to like,2/10,11 October 2021,"I'm really not understanding why this show is so popular. I'm half way through and only one of the primary characters is likeable. The main guy gambled away his life, including his relationship with his daughter. The women are whiny and annoying. The ""rivals"" are your classic vicious bullies. The only character I'm really rooting for is the Pakistani. The story might be interesting if they weren't all in there because of their own bad choices, but I'm just having a hard time getting through this series.

Still good, but they took it down at least a few stars.

655,network-561-589522,How fast can desperate humans turn into murderers?,7/10,13 October 2021,"The start and the idea were very promising: how far do desperate humans go to acquire money, how fast can ""civilized"" people become murderers only because they are told what to do: according to the rules of ""the game"".I especially like the idea that the players were perhaps just naïve and innocent in the beginning but then made a conscious decision to join the game and therefore accepting the rules. The victims become offenders.The series seems and is very brutal. But you can see many parallels to many war crimes that have happened over and over again in concentration camps, war prisons, purges.Unfortunately, the plot and the ending seem incomplete. Also the acting was not always good. And what happened to the translation and subtitles? Very often they say complete different things and sometimes
they don't make sense at all.I am not sure yet, if the series should end after season 1 or if it needs a conclusion."
656,Ctherra,Was Stephen King first?,8/10,4 October 2021,"Stephen King would find this familiar...his story The Long Walk was published in 1979 when he wrote as Richard Bachman, about an annual walk for boys from Florida to New York(if I remember correctly) with a large monetary prize for the winner. Those who could not walk at the required pace...were shot.I like this show so far. I'm on episode 4. It is pretty well made and makes me want to watch the next ""chapter"" Could it be better? Yes, but the story is good and it's alright the way it is.

657,hampton-overton,"Predictable, cliche, overrated",3/10,10 October 2021,"I'm baffled by the high reviews as I couldn't get past the second episode. The first episode was so cliche in setting up the main character and his situation it was painful to watch. Nothing original, just the same story of a guy that is lazy, steals from his mom, gambles, is a terrible father. Okay, we get it, it's why he goes to play this game. They had a chance to actually use an original approach to this 'desperate failure' needs quick cash, but nope, this series isn't up to it. Then you have to buy into a lot of completely unbelievable situations and places. I found myself fast forwarding through the 'vote off the island' scene. I finally gave up when they started the mom is now in the hospital. This is a soap opera with blood. No more. It's not even funny.I don't recommend this to anyone.

658,isefmert29,Overrated TV Show,5/10,2 October 2021,"It started out promising; I thought it would be a different touch to the topics that we have already seen in other movies: hunger games, the game, maze, the exam etc. But it never got to the point where all the violence makes sense. Characters do not make sense, scenario do not build up to something meaningful. All that mysterious show-business-kind-of costumes and staging lose their effect when the plot is unable to deliver a meaningful explanation. In each episode until the last scene, I expected a twist or some progress so that I could appreciate all the hype but nope. It did not happen. If the message was injustice and humans gotta make their way with it, that's been done countless times and sorry, this didn't sell it.

I watched it with my wife, while we were also watching Sneaky Pete .We were doing it one episode from each one. My wife was grabbed by this one and wanted to saw the end, i was less enthusiastic about it.The plot is reasonable , the actors are good with a bit of overacting here and there ,the korean it´s a weird language and i saw it on korean with subtitles. I think this is more hyped because it came from Korea and people tend to find it exotic.Overall to me it´s a 6. For my wife i think she would give a 8 or 9.

670,daniel-65836,"Strong start, poor finish",7/10,30 September 2021,"Very compelling opening episodes, but when the actual plot unravels it makes you go, ""Oh, that's just it? That's kinda lame"". Great acting still, amazing sets, overrides the glaring flaws of the series, an enjoyable watch overall. 7/10.

671,channellius,Strong start and middle but...,7/10,12 October 2021,"I've seen my fair share of survival genre shows and games, so I wasn't overly interested in watching this series, but since so many of my friends had seen it, I figured I'd give it a try. To my surprise, the first few episodes were quite compelling and the characters felt more 'human' and less two-dimensional than many other shows/movies/games I've seen in this genre.I think I was thoroughly enjoying this series up until I finished episode 6. Ep 6 was great, and emotional, but episode 7 onwards were just awful for me. Episode 7 in particular might've been the worst one. The challenge could hardly be called a 'game', and the VIP characters were unbelievably painful. I couldn't understand how the dialogue was so bad. The cuts to them and their cliche (and repetitive) dialogue made me lose that feeling of immersion I had with the other episodes. Episode 8 didn't feel like it really achieved anything, and episode 9... well, the 'twist' was quite unsatisfying. It didn't feel very believable, and there wasn't any closure with regard to the policeman and what he had attempted to send to the police when he got to the beach in the previous episode. It really just felt like there were some weird loose ends.So, I would give this show even a generous 10 stars for the first 6 eps, but I really was so disappointed by the subsequent three that I can only give it 7 stars.

672,brennon_goodwin,Big Surprise hit of 2021,8/10,1 October 2021,"I saw this while scrolling on Netflix and noticed it was trending on Twitter & such so I checked it out not fully knowing what to expect. This show is crazy....in a good way! Although some of the concepts and choices here have somewhat been done before it doesn't matter because I've never had an experience before, like I did with this show. Anytime a show/ movie can offer that experience it deserves recognition. Still not sure how to feel about the ending but this is definitely an awesome series. Also I would recommend watching this with the Korean dialogue and English subtitles, it feels more natural and you can hear the real actors performance this way.

674,ftzfatema,Squid Game,9/10,27 September 2021,"(Contains mild spoiler)
What an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that's the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn't answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I'll be waiting for.

675,mehdiscott,Amazing,10/10,2 October 2021,"Held in suspense throughout, a furious desire to click on ""next episode"" as soon as it ends ... The atmosphere totally shifted between the cruelty of the games and the aesthetics of the naive and childish colored sets, as well as the very soundtrack. Focused on classical music while acts of a nameless barbarism take place before our eyes... To watch in original version even if we do not understand anything in Korean so as not to miss the great actingThe ending foreshadows a season 2 while being relatively surprising as to the identity of the creator of the game. A few small questions remain, but nothing important enough to be disturbing.A great discovery that I recommend without hesitation if the big spurts of blood don't bother you too much.

678,npijlman,Anticlimactic thrill ride,7/10,7 October 2021,"This Korean show has great production value, a fun storyline, and some of the best AND worst acting possible. However thrilling its first half of the episodes may be, later on the show suffers from some bad pacing, acting and other irregularities. More importantly though, the show's big plot twist is already easily guessed after watching the first episode, which makes for an anticlimactic finale. Maybe a next season will tie up some of the many loose ends and will give some more depth to the otherwise rather shallow plot. All in all, it's a fun ride - however, not as good as the hype is letting you on!

But this tale delivers more than just shock value. It's a commentary on high stakes gambling where there is no risk greater than death. Children's games harken innocence while greed and sacrifice decide each players fate. The ""VIP's"" are the weakest link, depicted as caricatures of selfish rapacious greed; but even with their one dimensionality there is a lot of social commentary to consider.

Everything was great until they reached their limit of creativity and trying...long story short... everything stopped being serious and authentic like before and from now on it was a drag until the end... Second half was so mediocre and underwhelming and sadly even poorly executed.. Didn't even have a realistic feel to it like the beginnings...I'm impressed and disappointed at the same time...

687,raffydibansa,Poor Choices,6/10,25 September 2021,"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.

Yep the actors who played the VIPs sucked I just wanted to skip those parts and some other boring bits but you have to have them for the storyline but the games... I'm never giving anything away. I reacted out loud every time a game was revealed and yelled at the screen for them to choose something else even though I was wrong every single time. No one I know was willing to watch this show so it killed me to have no one to discuss it with. That's why I do these reviews.

695,nwbw-92973,What a series !,9/10,1 October 2021,"I cannot praise this series enough. At first, I didn't like some of the over-reaction from many of the characters but this might just be my own cultural failings. But, I loved the way the characters developed and interacted, their differing views and what they each 'brought' to the series. I agree with the other reviewers that E6 is just superb - it is a masterpiece of story telling in a way that Hollywood tends to forget. The acting was so good. All in all, this series has totally entertained me and surpassed my expectations. Thoroughly recommended.

697,angelarichardson-44685,Overrated,6/10,30 September 2021,"The games are somewhat interesting and the overall premise has some intrigue, but it lacks more than it gives. Poor acting, massive plot holes and a twist that's really average are ignored for mass carnage entertainment. I mean I get it - we all wanted to be entertained, even if it's poorly put together. The best kind of soup for the brain.

Easily ""A"" tier series until..... The ending.YES, Great story telling, the tension and flow and ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO STICK THE LANDING RIGHT and it FAILED. Resulting into a dragging episode and an 8 episodes wasted. I also have to mention ep.4 "" Rumble at night/ lights turn flashing"" scene, it's a bad idea filming against the light or in a dark area, let alone filming with flashy lights (hahahah). It's an unspoken rule but important, I nearly puke and I didn't know what is going on at that scene. That scene is bad but not as TRASH as the ending. Still I enjoy the series but the ending makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6.

Also, ""squid game"" title doesn't fit the story. It's nothing about the squid game (it shows 1 scene and 1 game onyl) nor metaphorically they're the squid itself. ""Child's play"" is more fitting. The last 2 games loses the tension too. The last episode shouldn't exist. Its ambitious and throws away those invested scenes. The plot twist makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6. From an impressive realistic views to let's wrap it badly and make characters think illogically. Still, I enjoy the series (Just forget the last episode exist haha) And BTW, VIP's = CRINGE. The acting so bad I thought they're gonna be killed early by an illogical cop (lmao) but nope, they attempted to build something for a sequel INSTEAD OF A GREAT ENDING."
702,be23zE,Great Fun but Don't Forget the Message,8/10,7 October 2021,"Squid Game: it's everywhere. It is almost inescapable at this point. There are countless memes on social media and hilarious news articles. I was hesitant to check this out when people told me to watch it. Many times the most popular pieces of art pander to the lowest common denominator. And, to be honest, Squid Game does this frequently but it is a hell of a ride and there are thick layers of food for thought hidden underneath.This is by no means a perfect show or a masterpiece so let's begin by getting my complaints out of the way. Firstly, this show spells so much out for the audience to an insulting point but I understand why. Squid Game is a Netflix original and is by no means a foreign gem, such as the likes of Harikari or Departures. This was clearly written and directed in a way so that even the most simple minded audience can enjoy the story. Surprisingly, it's not that big of a deal. It works in a similar way to Disneyworld: there are the joyrides, concessions, and Mickey Mouse for the kiddies and while adults love that stuff too, they also have a bar for the adults.One example of the aforementioned pandering are the God awful flashbacks. When Gi-hun learns that his daughter is moving to the United States with her stepfather and mother, we are given a flashback to the dinner sequence where this fact was pretty obviously hinted at that happened only a few moments prior. I mean come on. How stupid do they think their audience is (a rhetorical question of course)? We also have the front man's reveal, which could have easily been left a mystery. I mean, I guessed that even before the cop found out his brother had been a contestant but I'm sure that Star Wars-Luke, I am your father-reveal worked for the general audience. But let's not lie to ourselves, that was hilariously corny. I laughed my ass of during that scene.Which leads to my second complaint: the predictability but, again, it doesn't detract much from the plot. Aside from the reveal that the old man was the master at the end, most of the M. Night Shyamalan ""twists"" can be seen coming a mile away.With that said, there's really not a lot to complain about here. Squid Game is addicting. I watched the show by myself in two sittings (it would have been one if I did not have to wake up early to register my car) and then I watched a good chunk of the show again with my mom, and I already want to watch the show again. Why? Two reasons: It is addictingly thrilling and there are actually some well hidden hints and Easter eggs scattered throughout.So while it does pander, it left me with a lot to think about. The games as a whole are somewhat of a representation of capitalism, which is not some pretentious high school theory, the director has said the show represents the class inequality in Korea. Think about it, here we have 455 disenfranchised individuals who are willing to risk their lives and kill others for money, many without a second thought. They even offer the players the chance to leave if the majority vote in favor of such a decision. This is a genius mechanism that I will get back to in a second. So the players are caged animals here. Behind the scenes, we have psychopathic aristocrats laughing there ass off and placing bets. Don't you think some rich asshole funded this movie? The premise of this movie is not that different from life in these so called ""democratic"" nations. We slave away at jobs that pay next to nothing and if at any moment we, let's say, need a surgery, we will be in debt for a good portion of the rest of our lives. We are basically the contestants in this show and the higher ups at the corporations we work at are the VIPS.This brings me back to the voting system. The players cannot stop playing the game but they can leave if the majority vote in favor of quitting. We can't stop working or we will become homeless and die. But we can vote to tax the rich or increase the minimum wage, yet most of us are so enslaved to capitalism that we would write that off as communism because we aspire to become the next Elon Musk (think about how many college aged white dudes love Elon Musk. They worship a man who has enough to feed his entire country).Yeah, yeah. I know, I know. I got political. It's a touchy subject but it's true and Squid Game is unafraid to speak out on it in a pretty haunting way.Anyway, I don't really need to recommend this show to anyone. You're most likely going to get sick of hearing about it and watch it like I did. Many of the obvious aspects of the show have already been talked about so I wanted to take a few moments to discuss some things the average viewer probably did not consider. It's obviously a great show and you will probably see it.

710,BloodyHellSunday,TO EVERYONE HATING ON THE VIPS,9/10,30 September 2021,"This is a series from South Korea in mainly the Korean language
I am 99% sure the reason why the VIPs are talking the way they are is because of this
They are not acting bad, the acting is fine! What feels amiss to us is that they talk slowly and pronounce very clearly, and this is deliberate. They speak slowly and clearly because this show was intended for a Korean audience and not an US or even English speaking audience
and this is why it feels kinda off to those people
We are used to Netflix shows in US or British English where people speak perfect everyday English (whatever that means) and here they tried to ensure a non English speaker or someone with limited English skills can follow the VIP conversations
This is my theory I said what I said
Love this series and it's the best thing that's come off Netflix in a while so think for a minute and stop hating on this detail in an otherwise AWESOME show!

Reminded me of the 90s where I went through a phase of buying or renting every VHS tape that had a tartan label. From there I couldn't sleep for a while! This show is very good and will hook you in. However like other reviews it is slightly ruined by the cheezy B list VIP actors! It's like they ran out of actors late in the season and grabbed a few guys from a bar! Please take note of this for the next installment as it's an entertaining show.

720,dwhitebread-888-13582,"Stock characters, and predictable drama weaken a good social commentary",4/10,11 October 2021,"I appreciated the importance of Squid Game taking on the inequality and cruelty of Capitalism for the first half of this series. Then things got muddled. The plot becomes full of holes and dead ends. We find out that the only motivation for the Game was some bored, over-rich friends looking for fun, That's all. I was really expecting something original.Most of the characters never developed any subtlety. We are left with the Bully, the Greedy guy, the Crazy Lady, the Cool but Wise Young Women, the Clever Old Man, the Loser with a Heart of Gold, and a hundred Heartless Minions with no apparent backstory. And the VIPs were just comical.Squid Game cries out for a second season to explain all the lingering questions about the origins and motivation of the people who started and ran the Game. But I don't think I care enough about that to sit through another few hundred horribly cruel deaths again.

But that's it. I just liked it. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't anything new to me, I won't remember this as a great show, I won't remember it as something that made me think about it a long time after watching.It had nothing that stood out, no great twist, no real depth. Surely some people won't agree on this point, but if you consider the obvious criticism on capitalism shown here as something deep... yeah.I found the build up in the first 4 episodes considerably more enjoyable than the second half of the series. The ending was just ok. Nothing more.So in summary this was solid entertainment. Definitely not worth the hype but enjoyable if you have nothing better to do with your time."

There is Hunger games or Death race vibes ,But however i feel its way more predictable. For a TV series fan i think it obvious that from the first scenes where the games introduced can predict its a death game or like when meeting Number 01 player it gets the vibe that he is involved.When they first leave the games that they obviously come back.Only scene that i didn't get a vibe before was last scene that he kill himself.Nevertheless good thriller considering its Korean.

728,olajkarattila,Very recommended one time watch series,7/10,7 October 2021,"I've just finished the last episode yesterday so I gave myself a day to recollect my thoughts.I don't want to write spoilers but as I see how big is the hype around it it's almost impossible to do so.If you haven't seen any movies with similar message then then you'll probably will give this one higher score for sure.I saw many and have to say that it is a solid 7/10
The character build up starts okay. Later episodes mess up this with the so called VIP's characters are bad. Add bad acting too.The conversations are a bit plain.The storyline is too predictable but not bad.The settings and visuals are very good.The games are good too.The ending is very meh.So these are my thoughts without spoilers.(I watched it in English as I read about it is a slightly different then the Korean original)"

730,ashleigh_samantha_hayles,So close to a 10! LOTS OF SPOILERS!,9/10,1 October 2021,"The acting and character development from the main cast is outstanding! The storyline was AMAZING. I was hooked straight away.It would have received a 10 if the VIP acting was better, they were shockingly bad and sometimes hard to ignore.And there were also little things that were never finished/explained:
The coughing morse code from 28 to 29.The battery life of 29's phone, even the leader uses a landline.The police chief definitely caught some of what the police guy (29) was saying on the phone. Why was no back-up whatsoever sent to his location?Why did the last guy give up after just being bit in the leg but 456 was stabbed twice and able to fight and win? I'm guessing that he just gave up and wanted 456 to win?The married couple that returned and acted shocked that only one of them could leave alive. They knew there could only be one winner in the end.I was super gutted that the girl was randomly impaled by glass (why did they blow up the glass, it could have killed all three finalists, risking losing a final winner).Was 001 called number 1 as he was secretly the winner. Did he secretly want to let 456 win? Did he allow it to happen? Isn't that going against the ""fairness"" of the games?456 winning Squid Game as a child in the first scene in the pilot episode, totally ruined the series, I KNEW that would be the final game, so it was OBVIOUS he was going to win. I still enjoyed the ride, but it was something that at least should have had a flash back too during the last game, as I haven't seen anyone else make this comment; did they forget about it?His hair looked awful red. That is all.Why did he suddenly become impulsive and want to hunt down the gamers? Will their be a season 2? I don't understand how he thinks he can take them down; the police don't believe him and the leader/VIPs are billionaires so can hide everything/kill everyoneHe abandoned his daughter AGAIN.He was going to ditch the prize money AGAIN.When the first group of people were released, the prize money was meant to go to the bereaved families, but when the majority returned, the prize money remained. Does this mean they were lying? (because they secretly lied about a lot!) or was this a plot hole oversight?The leader said to keep an eye on those who didn't return to the game from the first round, but if I'm correct, nothing came of this? I was expecting it to flash outside every now and then, tracking those people down?One of the masked gang mentioned to 29 that if the top door in the tunnel ladder thing opened, the bomb would go off... 29 opened it later in the series whilst grinning at the leader, but no bomb went off? I was expecting a massive explosion to go off at any point as this was planted in our heads, but never happened. Bit disappointed with that.How did that annoying woman survive? When asked to partner up, she was left alone, why did they let her survive? But she was a weak underdog? That makes no sense... she survived the round but didn't have to compete?The police man that just dumped the diving gear on the rocks (that was being tracked), I kept thinking ""chuck it in the water so they're thrown off"" but no, he left it there and was easily found.Another police man one... He was trying to find his brother who had been recently untraceable. His brother was the leader... who had clearly been there a long time. How does this work? Or had he only ""disappeared"" during the latest games. This definitely needed more explanation.Now that I think about it, there were A LOT of plot holes, but during watching it and before I started analysing it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and likely watch again! I love geeking out like this; that's how I know when I've loved something; when I can't stop thinking and analysing it!

734,Lokroep,Amazing show from Korea!,9/10,29 September 2021,"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!"
735,sethrbingham,Captivating,10/10,26 September 2021,"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series.

This is one for sure. .Do yourself a favor dont dub it in with your language, hear and feel the real actor, his or her voice and emotions. The subtitles will come easily after the first 15 mins.. . I found the acting great..just ignore the VIPS part lol..that passes fairly quickly anyway..otherwise some you may become fond of, it causes emotions to rise and fall, there is mystery, suspense, some comedy, but mostly it holds you on the edge to what will be next. Who is who..and so forth. I enjoyed so much I went on the hunt for another Korean show..im now enjoying (not as good as Squid in my eyes)Sweet Home. Highly recommend Squid.

But still it has nice twists. I have to underline the costume design especially masks. The masks were great but the Fromtman's mask is a-ma-zing! It looks neutral and wierd as emotionless mask of Joey Jordison if not better! Using gaming console button signs as ranking in whole script was also a nice touch.Finally i came here to mention the horrible acting of the VIPs and looks like I am not alone! If i was one of them I would ask my part to be removed after watching others in episode gganbu for example. Their acting is a documented proof that you cant hide bad acting behind a mask. If they didnt had a peak on their collegues performance during the shooting, they can watch Edward Norton in Kingdom of Heaven at least. It is a free lecture...

742,barrys-2,"Great set design, but not much else",3/10,22 September 2021,"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs.

744,mamoizelle,Squid Games plot holes are still bothering me,9/10,3 October 2021,"First of all, what a series ! It looks so realistic compared to Alice in Borderland or Hunger Games. The VIPs acting were so bad and so fake ruining the contestants realistic acting.Some plot holes that are bugging me.1. What happened to the VIP guy that went to a room with the police and got photo taken with his phone? Did he threaten the Front Man for this incident or sue the game maker ?2. Why keeping all paper files of the squid Games? Everything are digitalized and looks so hi-tech with scanner, surveillance, etc. It doesn't make sense3. The old guy is already 'dead' in the marble game when he took of the mask and talked to the Front Man to greet the VIPs for him (ep.7). And at the same moment he explained (ep.9) to the Front Man he wanted to be down there join the game because it's more fun.What happened to the police and his phone whether all the photos were sent, we still don't know whether he is still alive or dead. Looking forward to season 2 (if there is any)

747,kikessandoval,"Amazing Story Lines, Bad Characters, Bad Ending",7/10,14 October 2021,"This is a very good and interesting show as you would see how it took over the Internet. The show is very creative its like if SAW and the olpyics and Korea came together to make a game. The story lines is very good a creative and original the show had somewhat good characters and the show still had some comedy in it and the gore is really awesome. But here is when it goes down when the VIPs arrive; they are rich men that are responsible for Squid Game. When they arrive to the Island is when the show starts to get bad. The side plot with the police officer trying to find his brother was good up until the. The boss of the Squid Game is the policeman brother and he kills him, that was pretty stupid and pointless to have him die just to find out his brother was running the game at that time. The characters are really good and some are pretty funny but the writers in some of the games decided to screw them off and kill them off. The ending was probably the worst ending ever, the ending leaves off with 2 people left and they have to fight to the death in a game of Squid Game an old Korean hopscotch type game. And the ending where it leaves the last main character going to head to Los Angeles and not deciding but just staying and stopping Squid Game was kinda dumb.

And in the end I put it back again This work is a purely television masterpiece.

760,BrokenDarkness,"Great idea, bad execution",6/10,10 October 2021,"The main ideas of the series is what money can buy in this world, what makes your life worth living, what is the cost of a human life. That is by itself a very good bunch of thesises to build up. But when I was watching this show, I always felt that person that was developing characters isn't suited for it at all. All the characters are very generic and cliched. At some point you could cling to them, feel some connection, root for them, the next minute you already feel sick of seeing them as they are being ruined for the sake moving the plot further. This is a typical battle-royal where you know that this exact character could die because he isn't written well enough and haven't got any screentime, but that other dude will certainly die because he's on your screen just because they need people for this kind of story.Having said that, there are still plenty of good moments (i.e. Episode ""Gganbu"" was really dramatic and this is great considering what I said above), very good quality of filming, interior of the scenes, costumes. Overall, this series is worth to watch, but beware of annoying stupidly written dialogues and poorly realised character progression. If you're okay with synopsis - go watch it! But that's not really any kind of masterpiece."

And this series plays so much with our feelings for example - we want both players alive but one has to die and it hurts so much. I loved and enjoyed this series so much but the last three episodes were hurtful. And VIPs ruined it because of what shitty acting had done the VIPs. I am happy with the ending because Season 2 of Squid games will be coming soon next year.

766,JamesR1973,"Excellent at the start, but disappointing finale",7/10,10 October 2021,"I wanted to give this 9/10, as I enjoyed the first 6 episodes immensely. Ok, it's not massively original in its premise, but the South Korean slant and the focus on individual debt made this more than interestingHowever, once the VIP's arrived I felt it lost its way a little and the switch to English was quite jarring (I watched it in subtitles). Whether it was deliberate or not, the ""acting"" and dialogue of the VIP's was pretty poor and riddled with unnecessary exposition and cliche. In addition, I felt the subplot regarding the stowaway policeman wasn't properly resolvedWhilst the finale wasn't terrible - it felt a little disjointed with some characters making decisions that seemed odd based on what they'd done before (Cho Sang-Woo for example in the Squid game). Also, the ""reveal"" in the skyscraper kind of ruined a few of the previous episodes.It's a shame, as this could have been an even better series than it actually was - but it is still definitely worth a watch.

767,Greyrat17,An Incomplete Masterclass,8/10,1 October 2021,"An emotional rollercoaster that is guaranteed to keep you at the edge of seat. The characters are great and despite not lasting long, form an everlasting impression on the audience, the show also touches on the subject of human nature and all that. My personal favorite character is Sangwoo, his development was just (chef's kiss).There's also well planned foreshadowing leading upto the big plot twist at the end that may not be visible at first watch.Although 9 episodes wasn't enough for this show, a lot of things were left unanswered like the In-Ho storyline, where does the organisation go from here, who they really are and what direction Gi-Hun's character will take from here. All of which are hinting for an exciting sequel.Although I'm slightly worried that S2 might not live up to the hype since well, everybody Died and the show has to build an even stronger cast of characters from scratch. Will the showrunners be able to succeed? We'll see.For now let's just make Netflix to fix their awful subtitles, it makes the dialogue look bad.

770,fruktoosi,Worst series I've seen in a loooong long time,2/10,13 October 2021,"What could I say about this overly budgeted piece of horrid excuse of a series. The story isn't very original, the plot and dialogue are very dull, boring and just bad. The most thrilling part of an episode is when it ends. The characters are unoriginal and poorly acted. I could go on but I will not be tearing my eyes out anymore and waste another thought with this.If someone can enjoy this I would like to know what it is that makes this even barely something to waste time on. If there's something good about this it is the cinematography. Some scenes were well shot and granted the feeling of some of it being real. Although when the props were involved, that ""joy"" faded away faster than it began and made it impossible to ever feel immersed to the world.Unwatchable. Wouldn't recommend.

I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles.

If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's definitely in my ""all-time favorites"" now.It was a really good show until one of the episodes, which elevated the show to the next level and cemented its place on my all-time favorites list. I would have given the series a 10, but I was disappointed with the ending, which is why I lowered the score to a 9.Despite the ending, I consider it a must watch, or at the very least, a must try.

The craze that the K-drama holds in worldwide it was only a matter of time to bang.All the hype, thrills and excitements aside, it is actually a pretty much predictable show where anyone with a common knowledge can predict it's final outcome correctly. You will be lying if you say you didn't see who is going to be the ultimate winner after just watching the pilot episode.The best thing about the show were those eventful journey, each and every round of the game were made with all possible thrills but yet again the ultimate results were some easy guess, it is what killed the core suspense of the show. However it doesn't decrease the addiction of finishing it overnight cause it had that ultimate Korean flavours. And when you know it's not only a mad epic game, the massages they tried to draw throughout the battles and emotional triggering was understandably the brightest side of its.

I watched the first two episodes and there was so much that could have been cut down. Ending up fast forwarding through the rest. Made sure to stop to watch all the contestants licking honeycomb for their life lol. Wouldn't recommend.

So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.

798,krumblburgh,A Million Squid Says You Love It,8/10,17 September 2021,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet."
799,jindalsaurabh-79309,The BEST thing EVER!,10/10,3 October 2021,"I have just finished it watching and I have no words to describe it. Trust me when I say this , It is probably the best thing I have ever seen. Story, acting , casting , production everything is very apt and top notch. I can't believe how perfect of a show is this. It is extreme in every human nature they portrayed like when they want to show you hate , friendship, trust , action, backstabbing every emotion is of very extreme kind. It also teaches us that money is not everything. Those who have money and those who don't are sad in one way or the other & We should help others no matter what. I will give it 10 out 10. All hail to Korea for this treat. Love from India 🇮🇳

808,cnh-95573,Wow what a ride!,8/10,26 September 2021,I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.

811,annabelfwatts,Korean Battle Royale vibes,8/10,30 September 2021,"Absolutely fantastic series. Strong memories of the classic 00's Japanese cult classic Battle Royale.In a strange way it's a comforting season to watch. (Now, hear me out!) As we are aware of how many games are to be played, we are able to prepare ourselves each episode for the next game.Of course somewhat predictable storyline with the detective brother and front of house man. That's the second storyline, we need to distract us from the main.I'm not the only one who cried their eyes out when Ali the old man died. We wanted to the good guys to win!Although the protagonist isn't too likeable at the beginning, his character growth is excellent and looks badass with red hair.Cinematography was beautiful. The mash up of bright and dark colours, went so well with themes of the show.Like most films/shows, it's better in the language filmed in, with subtitles. The dubbed version was absolutely fine too!Ending was brilliant. Iconic anime antihero going to get some vengeance.Hoping for another season, great show. RIP sweet Ali!

824,akosijasher,Unpredictable and Impressive lines!,9/10,28 September 2021,"This series really exceeded my expectations! It's almost close to perfection actually. The rules and regulations of the game isn't that unfair. Moreover, it's the most considerate survival game challenge i've ever seen. Given the fact that they themselves are the one who made the decision to participate.I can see in this series the combination of gantz, saw, the purge, money heist and alice in borderland. If i were to compare this to Alice in Borderland, i definitely would say this is better. Maybe because of the pandemic when it was release and made but nevertheless, i must say that the Squid Game has a very unique content.Games are not too complicated and not that easy but they needs some improvements. Games actually went well because of the certain roles of the players and great portrayals!And lastly im very fond of the thrills the series brings in every episode that makes you end up rushing to see the next scenarios in the next episodez.

It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked.

827,omorris-71287,This was outstanding! Watch this ASAP,9/10,20 September 2021,"The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality.

830,leovincent-12940,I had to skip through parts to make it to the end,3/10,1 October 2021,"Forget about people complaining about the acting of the VIP characters, the acting overall was bad. It was distracting, took you out of the scene and was unintentionally humorous.I didn't care much for the characters. I wasn't interest in them. They obviously wanted you to care about the old man but frankly I found him annoying and was hoping he would die and get off the screen ASAP.One of the big ""reveals"" you can see coming a mile away. The other, you likely won't see coming but I didn't care much when it happened.I wouldn't have made it through the series if I didn't fast forward and skip boring parts... and there were quite a few.

833,deekleeshy,"Great Show, Let down by a few things.",7/10,24 September 2021,"First of all, I'll talk about what I like! The concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.Characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.Other characters not so much, there's an edgy North Korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. ""I don't trust people"" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, I dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.The dubbing is also awful, I don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was Netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.I'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10."
834,dpickles-56507,Brilliant but Not Perfect,9/10,9 October 2021,"This show seems simple at first, but later expands what makes it great. With endearing characters, story, and an interesting take on human nature. Showing what anyone would do for money. However, like a lot of dubs, there is a bit on uncoordinated lips. But that can be expected.

835,emiaroux,Too much Plot Hole + Plot Armour,6/10,22 September 2021,"Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man.

838,antantwan,HoYeon Jung Acting debut is it for me 💕,9/10,28 September 2021,"I enjoyed the suspenseful ride and twisted concept of the series! Actor HoYeon Jung stood out most to me; especially after finding out it was her acting debut. Death scenes in this show comes by form of execution, which was almost too much to watch at times. Show lacks no detail within the games facility and does a great job of forming bonds and friendships in such a doer situation! Only thing I wish for was a ending that brings actor Lee Jung-jae closer to his family (daughter) at the end.... More than just a phone call was needed after leaving her standing in the rain like that 😠. Overall great show, great acting, great concept, season 2 worthy Netflix!

839,towolewa,Good psychological horror thriller,8/10,10 October 2021,"This show is really good. If you like horror and thriller u are going to love this. I mean the plot is outstanding and the acting was well almost flawless. The game really messes with your head and u don't know who to trust. I mean the logic inside it is dope. It is survival of the fittest,the series actually made me think that more than one winner can emerge. My favorite game was the glass game .I mean that part was really tense. I also like the fact that they killed of all the characters apart from Jamie sung or whatever his name is. I liked some of the other characters but killing some of the main characters, i did not see that coming. It caught me off guard. Last but not least,the plot twist was crazy i never expected it to be the old man it was mind blowing but then it made a lot of sense because he was player number 1. Well let's get to the rotten part. Some parts were predictable,like the part where that girl sacrificed herself for the other girl and the part where the guy in the mask was the detective's brother. Other than those two events,it was a really good show. I don't really like the way it ended tho i mean if it ended like that's i don't see any point for a season 2. Well it is a solid 8/10 for me.

847,subreality-864-770504,Kaiji without the psychological complexity,7/10,22 September 2021,"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon.

I was especially intrigued as I know Jung Ho-Yeon from the fashion industry and worked with her on many fashion shows. Didn't know she could act as well as she did and look as unattractive that her role called for. The only but for me was the VIPS and the manner in which they were portrayed. It was vulgar, crude and racist and a total turn off for me.

A wonderfully performed and dynamically directed ensemble that couldn't have cost half a fast and furious, watch this show if you have any time at all and remember that you as a member of the 1st world are the villain of this existential cacophony.

852,yoav-moran,Shiny but empty,6/10,7 October 2021,"There are some good things to say about this show: good actors, good cinematography, some good ideas.But these smokes and mirrors hide the main flow: no soul. Everything there is too engineered to feel real. When hundreds of people stand, they distribute evenly in the space. When hundreds fire, their bodies are scattered evenly in the field. When a vote is made, the distribution between Yes and No is kept evenly until the last one that looks like he just realized he needs to think about it - for suspense. The bad guys are total Nazis, the good guys are banal, similar too much to others as in the Hunger Games.This is a show engineered to make us excited, and like the players looking at the huge piggy bank we swallow it eagerly.

853,papa_johnsson,Sorry - Not sorry,5/10,12 October 2021,"Sorry to all the fan boys out there.But Squid Game isn't that good.And it is no where near 10 star good as 24% of all users reviewed it to be.The ""play a game / complete a course or die""- plot isn't new or innovative. The acting is exaggerated (like the villains from the pokemon cartoon) and the final game/ending/winner is no surprise to anyone. The show has some good moments (most of them in the GGanbu episode), and you easily watch every episode in one go, in a eager to find out who will be eliminated in what order.The best acting perfomances goes to Jung Hoyeon and Lee Yoo-Mi through out their short apperances in the show, but especially in the GGanbu episode.The good perfomance is though quickly forgotton with the performances of the ""rich white men"" whose acting must be the worst through out the show - perhaps through out Netflix.So - decent, but no where near other shows with this rating.Love the track suits!Btw. How do they fit that many people in that tiny boat; how does the job application looks for this game; whats up with the organ harvest side story; they obviously want to keep the island/game a secret, but yet they send everybody home to tell the world about it.

I hated the ending. Gi-hun went back to being a loser and just forgot about his daughter for a year? I get guilt but damn I was hoping he would've at least changed his life. The old man was behind everything..okay but i didn't really care for this reveal. It didn't do anything. I wish we learned more about the Frontman and his brother. He just shoots him and that's the end of it. All in all, it was just alright. Episodes were too long and dragged out.

858,xyntacx,I'm in!,10/10,12 October 2021,"One thing I was sure of, was that the Battle Royale genre was ridden with poor scripting and substandard acting, so I never did watch any of them. And having heard Squid Game being heaped together with Battle Royals I couldn't care less about, I begun watching with low expectations. And what a horribly pleasant surprise it was! You'll get character depth and story structures you wouldn't expect from the genre. Maybe it won't live up to the hype for Battle Royal aficionados, but for the casually curious ones, you need not to worry that this will be a waste of your time. I gave 10 out of 10 as Squid Game expands the survival horror genre in general, and obviously raises the bar for the sub genre of Battle Royals.

860,shargav,Visually striking and a great story,9/10,29 September 2021,"Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!

862,mazrekajalban,Enjoyable society-critical psycho thriller,8/10,1 October 2021,"I liked the show. It's addictive, well paced and some of the contestants really acted well.A lot of reviewers judge the acting of the VIPs. I would say, it is not bad acting but rather they show how pathetically boring and disgusting people can be, visualizing that just having lots of money makes you no one special.And the end is pretty logical to me. It doesn't require money to be a good parent. If he gambles 20 dollars away which were given to him for his daughter's birthday, why should he act differently when having millions on his bank account? Love is something money can't make a difference on. A true loving father would never be in this game, but rather be motivated just by the presence of his daughter to make his life right and be there for her as a father and not with presents.

Honestly, it does not deserve the 8.6, and it does not deserve all the hype around it. There wasn't anything original or anything others hadn't done better before. I'd give it a 5/10, for being perfectly average if it stole only 2-3 hrs of my life rather than a whopping 9, but here we are. I kept watching in the hopes that something crazy was about to happen, right until the end, that justified all the craze, and was left disappointed when it finally ended. Give it a pass if you have anything slightly better than average to watch instead.

871,Delta4220,"Incredible start, horrible finish",6/10,6 October 2021,"First five episodes are incredible.You get a mysterious setting with characters to which anyone can relate to, even if you are not a few million in debt.After the first five episodes however, things begin to crumble.You start getting fed information about the whole mystery which ruins the viewer's expectations as things like this are best left unknown.The whole plot line of the side cop Cho Sang-Woo who is looking for his brother and is trying to bring the games down is absolutely pointless, he accomplished nothing, only to find out that his own brother is pulling the strings.He dodges compromised guards, disgusting forced gay interactions and runs like a wild animal, outswimming a gps tracker underwater. One would think that they would at least see him passing them on the gps tracker.The old man Il-Nam who's ganbu tries to trick him in order to live, comes back from the dead, only to reveal nothing. His whole buildup and emotion during that episode where he initially dies is absolutely destroyed by having him be a plot twist VIP at the end.The rewatchability continues to crumble with each plot point.The games go from actual logic and quick thinking to absolute chance and stupidity. An entire character, Kang Sae-byeok dies from a level getting self destroyed? Like why? Why do you kill off a character in such a meaningless way. Yes Sang-Woo finishes her off, but brings absolutely nothing to the show. She would have had 5 minutes tops from the incredible blood loss due to a huge glass shard ending her.Yes the American VIPS are trash and the dialogue sucks, but they are not the worst part.The last final epic game that kids play in teams is decided to be a 1v1 as it's the show's epic name. SQUID GAME.The most boring ending game to have a 1v1 with. Would be a hundred times more entertaining if they added more people to it, as it's meant to be played.And to top it all off after our main protagonist gets out of there he is so shocked that he is late to treat his mother and she dies, that he absolutely forgets about his daughter, his friend's mother who somehow did not get her shop taken, as it was mentioned that his friend bet his mother's shop and the young girl Kang's little brother.It takes him a year to actually act and do something, because the old man reaches out to him and meets him one last time.And instead of meeting his daughter to be a good father for once in his life, like he earlier mentions a few times, he decides to be the big strong man and take the games down which had him mentally broken for a year.I understand that he did not want to spend the money, but at least take care of your friend's mom and a little boy. He could have even given a hand to Ali's family after he saved his life.When you get such an incredible start and so much potential in the beginning, it's not easy to keep up the quality. The actors played absolutely fantastic ,but the writers just did not handle those episodes well enough which pretty much ruins the buildup of the previous episodes.

872,ksears-94132,Solid 8-8.5,8/10,4 October 2021,"For the last +2 years I've been getting into the Korean productions. It's a severely under apriciated market with good scripts, acting and cinematography. Sadly my fellow westerners are hesitant to subtitles but luckily some great series like this one get picked up in the mainstream giving them the recognition deserved.This is as such, and the hype is deserved.Yes the VIP come across as ruining it but I hate to say it, our western loud entitled abrasive personalities is what they are perpetuating and I find the annoyingness of watching the VIP reflects how rude we come across in other cultures and is actually warranted.My only complaint with the series is the ending, I get it but slightly drawn out and clearly just to set up a second season.

I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating."
874,taragoluza,Definitely not a bad show but the hype is for nothing,6/10,11 October 2021,"It's not even THAT original and even though it was interesting to watch I truly don't get the hype this show got over night. I'd recommend it if someone really enjoys the mystical drama thrikler with a lot of violemce type of show/movie, but if not, there really is no reason to watch the show. Characters aren't likeable and like I said even though it seems original at first, there's a lot of elements taken from other movies/shows (Saw, money heist)

876,nspacy,Will go down in history as one of the best,10/10,13 October 2021,"Aside from Narcos and Sopranos this has to be one of the best series ever made. It sucks you in from the very first episode and it drags you in front of the TV to binge watch the entire series all in one day. The acting is incredible. The storyline is suspenseful. The production is magnificent. Overall thank God it took some Asians to make a really good series because Hollywood became all trash.

878,luuthaiquangkhai,The worst among this genre I would say,1/10,18 September 2021,"If you're not used to this Survival Game genre, you might find it exciting. As a long fan of this genre, I can make sure that this series is undoubtedly one of the worst among all. The problems lie severely in 2 key points that make a good Survival Game Film: The games and The story-telling. While the games, without exaggeration, are horribly boring, forcing, and lack the creativity to the point I don't even know if they actually spend time thinking about the game or they just pick it up randomly on the internet. The storytelling method badly worsens it with so many unnecessary scenes and lines. Towards the end of the series, I have to watch it with 1.5x speed, and still, it is irritatingly slow. That is not the worst yet. The SUPER CRINGE appearance of the VIPs just to show labor class discrimination is unacceptable and horrifically unnatural. They try to put on life-lesson so bad that the lesson turns out to be pathetically ridiculous.Tl,dr: this movie is cringed, poorly told, wayy overrated, and definitely one of the worst in this genre."
879,cnile-56470,Piece of garbage.,1/10,13 October 2021,"Don't waste your time on this pathetic series. You would be better off watching paint dry. Again Netflix produces more garbage entertainment. Gratuitous violence. Stupid plot. Unbearable acting.

884,imran_munir,Definitely more hype than substance,6/10,13 October 2021,"Having watched Alice in Borderlands last year which was amazing I was excited about all the buzz about this show. It's entertaining, but the acting is sometimes cringey and other elements drag on like episode 2 when they all go back and decide to return to the game which could've been done in a 15 minute segment. It's fine as a show and entertainment but a stand out show or original it's not. Definitely a case in which social media and buzz has outdone the product.

887,mrfantasticoloyeah,"Very interesting idea, decent execution.",6/10,23 September 2021,"First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it.

888,dmooretgs,If Running Man and Battle Royale had a baby,9/10,4 October 2021,"Without crossing that line of spoiler alert there is two glaring issues with this series but not enough to make this unenjoyable.I wish these issues where at the beginning not the end of the series but it was one hell of a watch. As I sat there it made me remember films like Old Boy... fight club and Charlie and the chocolate factory. Last 15 mins of episode 1 it really goes off. It was like of running man and battle royale had a baby.If your not hooked by end episode one then I wouldn't bother continuing but you will for sure. I voted 9 which was a little higher than I would have but people voting 5 is well out or order also so it is my way to balance it out as this has to be the best tv series I have watched this year.

892,tim-1526,Worth sticking with.,7/10,20 September 2021,"Netflix seems to be able to find these ""box set""versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series.

894,gianmarcocibella,Could have been gold,6/10,6 October 2021,"When i first heard about this show, the first thing that came to my mind was Money Heist. And not exactly a robbery with a lot of unnecesary extra seasons. I thought huge budget spend on set, CGI and entertainment while the dialogue and storyline is given to the bunch of guys who knows how to do a lame predictible money maker series.I gave it a try and after watching the first episodes i started to think that i might made a judgement mistake.For a moment i was caught in it's mistery, unpredictable events and complex moral issues. You get to judge the competitors while at the same time realize you would probably do the same monstrosity's they are commiting. You see great acting, scenes that make you fantasize abouth the old days in South Korea when all of them where playing these infantile games without their debts, guilt and traumas. Even tough i'm no korean and never been in Korea, i felt nostalgia.Then, the show starts to have a few flaws in matters of coherence wich you try to ignore to keep having a pleasent experience. And for moments, you do. You try to understand the unnecesary plot about the young police who extremely easily breaks into a secret, dangerous facility runned by a cruel, wealthy organization who seem to have been running this games without problem for at least 2 decades. If that's not enough, the showrunners give you a terrible, incoherent explanation about his missing brother. It's almost like the tape of the series came by mistake with a few Mission Impossible scenes in the middle of it.There's a few scenes and cliché dialogues that makes you wonder if the series is looking to play safe as another hit in terms of Netflix views, or more as the daring, complex drama that was, at least, what i was expecting it to be.My other problem was that after 5 episodes i realized i wasn't empathizing too much with the characthers (with the exception of competitor 001, of course).And then i arrived at the Climax of the series. Episode 6. The moral concept is taken way beyond in this game as competitors pick their closest partner without knowing that they're gonna have to eliminate each other. You get to see the real face of all the characthers and the cast best perfomances. There's a lot of betrayal, hesitation, tension, characther exploration and development, and of course, the heartbreaking endings to each of the main eliminations. It was a perfect ending for Jy-Yeong, Ali and the old beloved 001.After that perfect episode, you are blown back to reality and the shows continues to fell apart.1.- One of the more interesting characthers of the show, Sae-Byeok get's fataly injured in the more stupid and meaningless way.2.- The plot of the police guy confirm's itself as totally unnecesary.3.- The closure of the games it's no much more than decent.4.- The plot twist about the old man being the host of the games is just stupid and gave bad closure to a characther who had originally a great arc.5.- The last scene where the protagonist doesn't take the plane in order to fight against the whole organization by himself?? Am I a watching John Wick or something? What about the daughter he promise not to lie anymore and take care of? It seems like they destroyed all his characther development.It seems like, this show had everything to be a cult classic and instead preferred to be the popular easy to digest Netflix hit i was expecting it not to be.

The setup and the design of the games were very cool and I liked Sae Byeok she was badass. Apart from that I thought it was an okay series, seen better, seen worse.

Each set looked like the spent millions and millions of dollars and it was so unique and absolutely amazing! Very gory and violent sometimes in a comical way. I love it.

902,gsi96,Rough but great representation of the world.,9/10,11 October 2021,"This was a great representation of how the world revolves around money and capitalism. It shows our modern day society in a brutal yet true way.Some scenes might be shocking for some audiences but it really puts your mind in a situation to think and see things in a more realistic way.People who are desperate for money are willing to do whatever it takes to take them, even die, betray and kill other people. It shows how everyone's true nature comes to the surface in the attempt to gain money. Yet the rich entertain themselves on the sight of desperation and think of these people as ""horses"" as they said that are just a piece in a game and their life doesn't worth anything more than to entertain them.This is the true nature of capitalism and our society. The richest man who created the games out of his boredom who thinks so less of poor people that are nothing more than pieces in his game, to the other rich people who just enjoy the games, to the head of the games, to the workers who are working for them and just obeying orders and who are also divided hierarchically and lastly to the players of the game who mean nothing. On top of that the head of the games continuously speaking of equality during the games giving them a false sense of equality when it actually doesn't exist because the rich are always worth more than them. So they create a false sense of security that every works out equally for everyone so they don't realize the real inequality that exists and that the only ones they have to turn against is each other.If we put this in our society, the people who hold all the wealth and can control the world, to the people who benefit from them like big companies etc, to the people working for them and obeying orders (working force who are slightly more advantaged than the players but also hierarchically divided like CEOs, managers, employees, etc ) to the less fortunate who struggle and are taken advantage of for the sake of the rich gaining more money and apart from that their life means nothing.I would definitely recommend it if someone wants to take a deeper look and don't just stay at the surface of the games."

907,nesrineben,"Strong premise, mediocre execution",6/10,10 October 2021,"The premise is interesting end entertaining. However, the character development is very poor and random (ie. Characters decide to suddenly become ethical out of nowhere and despite it contradicting their whole previously established traits).The justification behind the games is also very underwhelming even though it was meant to be some kind of big reveal.This show gives very much a ""we live in a society"" vibe... Some plot twists feel like they were written by a 12 yo middle schooler.I don't know if it's the norm for Korean shows but sometimes the acting feels cartoonist although most of the time the acting is pretty strong. Also beautifuly shot.6/10 don't believe the hype."

The games are entertaining and full of twist and turns. Good character growth. Only thing that is stopping me from giving this a ten is, the rushed ending or so it seems and the VIP's less than stellar acting.

It's bingeworthy and keeps your attention all of the time. The characters have great development and the story is not afraid of killing off characters either (duh). But my favorite part has to be the design and symbolism. The colors, outfits, game rooms etc. From the boxes the corpses are put into to the contrast of colors. Everything just makes sense together. No one is safe in these games. And the ending is quite satisfying with a full circle moment. I recommend everyone to at least watch the first episode. If they enjoy it they will certainly enjoy the whole series.

Lots of blood. Weirdness. Almost John Waters-esque.

928,eminayuuki,I get the hype still,7/10,29 September 2021,"Definitely predictable and not original. Plus too much exposition.By unoriginal, I mean that this kind of story already exists, but I get the hype since it's a visually attractive adaptation of a pre-existing plot.Anyone thinking this is fresh needs to watch more movies. And ""the similarities stopped at the first game"" my a**. The glass bridge is just a lesser Sky-High Hopscotch.It could have been just one season, since whatever the old man's motive is, it ain't that interesting.7 = good.

931,AstelleVey,A blast to watch mixed with disappointment,7/10,2 October 2021,"I enjoy watching a lot of death game movies and shows similar to squid game, so when I heard its popularity I was instantly intrigued, not only was it so talked about, but it had really high critic scores. Now, I try my best to not have ratings or my expectations to cloud my judgement when watching, so that's not the reason why I think squid game is only a 7/10.With all the other content I've seen with similar foundations, this one stands out. Not only is it a series with a high budget, but it's Korean. I'm not well knowledgeable in the Korean culture, it's film/show industry or it's childlike games, but I was definitely shocked when watching this. Most western content I've seen usually has low budget and pretty weak acting, but this is the complete opposite here. These well written characters were so easily brought to life by everyone....except the VIPs but I'm sure everyone knows how bad they are. Not only was the acting incredible, but the accompanying score and visuals made it so this show was so excellently crafted.The main plot of squid game is relatively simple. There are people who need to pay debt and so they play games to win a lot of money, nothing original. They get tested/challenged by someone, who randomly goes up to them, targeting them, to see if they are worthy enough to enter their competition of children's games. This test is simple, play ddakji. Winner pays the other 100k won. Since the player cannot afford it after they lose, the businessman slaps them instead, and they keep going. The test here is, will the player keep on gambling the money they don't have. If so, then they get handed a business card, containing the number to call if they accept the invitation. So already, the start shows us how these games will work out, you're gambling something so heavy for something you so desperately need in return. So when they're on the island, they play 6 games over 6 days, death happens every time, you get the idea. I think it's here I should mention, there is a background meaning to a lot of this. The Front Man sometimes mentions about equality. However, if we take this morality of this, some events just don't match up. The biggest example I can think of is the bridge with glass tiles. This was so incredibly stupid that it was here (well before with the VIPs]) that started the train wreck of the show. In the other games, if you had a choice, you still were able to win:
-Choosing the shape for ppopgi, despite being at a huge disadvantage for choosing the umbrella, it is still possible to beat it.-Choosing teams for tug of war, even if you have a weaker time, you can have strategy to win
-Choosing the pair for the marbles, we saw many ways how this could be done, either manipulation, gambling, or skill, yet you still had a fair chance if you knew what you were doing. Even one guy playing used the morality of equality to try and increase his chances of winning because he knew that's how the games work.-But then you have the glass bridge. The commentary by the VIPs in the show were indeed correct. Going straight at the front and straight at the back are both disadvantages, which is true. However, the people at the front so clearly have a disadvantage that's it's basically impossible to win if you're in the first 9 people. Sure, there could have been strategies thought of to test each glass, but for games that made it so you still have a chance no matter what you pick, this is a bit out of place. Oh and that glass explosion at the end is incredibly stupid. Tbf this whole game is stupid, were they really gambling their entire playercount on 1 game? We know this is for entertainment after all, as they even decided to make the bridge harder last second. What's so entertaining about all your players dying at once?Ok so that's not to say every other game is perfect. Red Light, Green Light has the problem of bullets not being 100% fatal allowing for 2nd chances, other people being moved when half the game stampeded in retreat, the inconsistency of what considers ""movement"".Another huge problem with the show is the subplot. The plot of the detective (I think he's a detective?) searching for his brother. Not only did I just not care about this plot because we don't have much going for the detective character, but it's ending and setup is so flawed. Why not check on the constantly suspicious looking guard earlier? Why was he able to get away just because the doctor shouted? Why did he waste his only bullet at the end? And not only that, the reveal that the front man was his brother, whilst not obvious, wasn't ""WOW I did not see that coming"" either. In fact, after the reveal, the sub plot just ends. Nothing comes out of knowing who the Front Man is. This whole subplot was just useless in the end, and only served a purpose so we know what's happening with the doctor. Speaking of which, I get why he got shot in the end, but what if he was forced into helping the guards? Why did the guards even try to kill him when they need him for their scheme? If they had to kill the doctor, why not the other players who got told about the game by the doctor himself? You could probably remove around 90% of this subplots content and you would have the same thing in the end. The detective doesn't achieve anything, we the audience don't obtain anything out of it besides from an attempt of a huge shocking reveal.Despite my problems with the plot, the characters in this show are amazing. Nearly all of the ones we spend time with are unique, interesting and dynamic. Seong Gi-hun is an incredibly executed character. Being quite naive yet smart at times, he's more human than the characters he surrounds himself with, and yet overtime, his humanity starts to decrease, but it never breaks, even in the final game, he couldn't bring himself to kill his childhood friend, despite all that trauma, and even offered a withdrawal from the game. And yet, his emotions still cloud him. He's not perfect, he's a flawed individual. We see this so clearly at the start, when he finally wins ddakji and was about to slap the businessman, so eager for revenge, so into his anger at losing that he forgot what he was playing for. This was so beautifully mirrored in the last game, the squid game. At many moments, he had the chance to get victory, to walk into the circle. He didn't have to fight or kill his friend, he could have let the guards do it for him once he claimed victory, but because of his anger, he was too into it, he forgot what was on the line, and despite how in the first episode he was easily able to attempt the slap on the businessman, here he couldn't bring himself to kill him despite the fighting. It's so subtle yet that character development is huge. Although he definitely does have plot armour. Every single game, he won barely, always at the last second. Even with the fight against his best friend, he was about to die but quickly turned the tables. I'm fine with this happening for the first 2 games or so, but every time? It gets old and repetitive.Cho Sang-woo is another incredibly written character from the start. He's cold. He's in this to win. And, opposite to Gi-hun, his humanity actually breaks down as time goes on. Sang-woo is, without a doubt, the smartest player in the game. He tries his best to increase his chances of winning, he tries his best to eliminate possible threats. He's the cause of the most emotional scene in the entire show. He looks the least likely to be someone like him, and yet it makes sense. You don't want to feel human in this game, you need strategy to increase the chances of survival, him being this character makes him the smartest, and yet, Gi-hun can't accept it. Ironically, Gi-hun keeps calling him smart but when it comes down to his smartest thinking, Gi-hun rejects it. He rejects the fact his childhood friend is like this. Not only was their chemistry so natural, but when they had conflict, that also felt so realistic. My only problem is, I just don't feel like he's a real character himself. What I mean is, we know Sang-woo isn't a psychopath, he does what he has to do to survive, but yet he shows no signs of remorse. No guilt. And it would have been better if at the start of the show, he wasn't already like this, making his change much more damaging.Ok so Sae-byeok is a pretty ok character. She has an interesting backstory, but the show just doesn't utilize her to the best they could. In episode 2, we had the chance to see the main characters and their lives, them realising it's much better to be in the games. And yet, we barely get any screen time with her. I understand at this point she wasn't a main character yet, but they could have at least done something to make her feel more complete. And then with the marble game, we see glimpses of sadness from her after killing that one irrelevant female character, and yet, that wasn't touched upon either. And for the most irritating thing, her death. Ye her death is dumb. Well not all of it. I like the fact Sang-woo finishes her off, but the fact the glass even exploded in the first place is just a problem. I thought everyone was supposed to have an equal chance, Front man? I guess not. Felt like a cheap way to write in her death so the 2 childhood friends can have a 1v1 I guess.The other characters are great too, but unfortunately I don't have room to explain here sadly. Ji-yeong and Jun-ho are still irrelevant characters, Deok-su's death feels so out of place also, and the final twist at the end of the show is dumb.Also one thing that triggers me a lot about this show is the use of slow mos. Stop!

A truly incredible message about life, death, struggle, success, and the poor and the rich. Fully entertaining for every second. There are very lovable and well developed characters that you can't help but get attached to, and evil characters that you can't help but hate. Great story. Definitely a 10/10.

935,Jayslapit,Amazing show definitely worth experiencing,8/10,29 September 2021,"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more."
936,shugineer,Fav part- red light green light,10/10,9 October 2021,"I just can't get enough of the games! What a mess! I hated saw, liked hunger games, loved this show. I loved all the characters. I didn't understand why they had those side stories with the harvesting bodies and the cop. Really added nothing to the story. Otherwise this show is so omg it'll keep you watching especially when all the bodies fall in red light green light. What a wild ride! I write novels and this writer did something in this story that I can never do to my stories. Kill them off! Lol.

It's predictable and the acting was not what i'd expect from a show hyped so much. I watch a lot of kdramas and I can understand why it's hyped with people that don't watch kdramas, it is entertaining, deadly game.I love watching psychological thrillers, but this was the same trope over and over again. It's getting pretty boring. I gave it 5/10 because it was entertaining at some points to watch, but I wouldn't say it's good.A lot of psychological thrillers like tunnel, train, abyss, etc. Are a 10/10 to me.

Oh boy was I wrong.Nicely produced, almost perfectly executed. You feel the tension from start to finish. The actors are are spot on (apart from the VIP's in episode 7).You feel and want to know more about them.This is how good it is.Have a go, you won't regret it.Pure entertainment.

950,cuti1406,A below average series,6/10,22 September 2021,"This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues. This one does not earn its score."
951,Cluuxp,It has its moments.,6/10,13 October 2021,"Was recommended to watch the series and watched all episodes over a few days. There are good moments and great characters here and there. But overall the series can be described as a friend of mine said as gore-porn. If you like bloody series like the walking dead then this is something for you.The series starts strong but struggles to keep the level.I hope that they do not make a second season as this should just stand alone.Happy to have seen it. Not going to watch it again.

952,Neekyrodrigues,Are you willing to take a chance?,9/10,5 October 2021,"Another shining example as to why more people should stop betting on an old horse like Hollywood and start putting their money on International Cinema. In this instance it's Korean cinema, Squid Game is a beautiful example and a potential gateway drug for many to get into Kdrama or maybe just international cinema in general. If you're tired of the sequels, prequels, reboots or remakes then take a risk into the world of subtitles and watch this. You'll find yourself with something new, fresh and potentially eye opening.

953,missessence78,Best description? Uncomfortably genius! And quite disturbing!,9/10,18 September 2021,"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*"
954,Anniejamesmangarova,"It's a nice show, but ...",5/10,10 October 2021,"The idea is great, no matter that it's similar to the Hunger Games - after all the original script is not earlier then 10 years old, before being financed by Netflix. I'm really impressed by the South Korean's actors - incredible work! Nevertheless the plot was very predictable and on top of that I know what is going to happen and it's happening for 10 more minutes on the screen - very slow and protracted action ... There were some moments, like the dead of the policeman/ brother, where I wasn't sure what am I watching - Indian tv series with a lot of slowmo reactions to a dramatic action or what?

960,Vicissitude24,it was good til epidode 8,6/10,26 September 2021,"The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode.

I can look past the bad acting from some of the cast because it fits in the Korean and Anime style/genre, but the plot holes and bad writing is a deal breaker. Just one example: in the tug of war episode, they had to break up into teams of 10 ppl. But there is no way there would naturally have been the correct number of people to make exact teams of 10. Just bad writing. It's been hyped a lot. There are lots of these types of instances, but I won't type them all.

The story structure took on the dark aspects of Darwinism but could not show the consequences. Director By putting on pleasant music, tries to make the audience sympathize with a psychic killer who has killed many people. The series is very immoral and is not recommended at all because it portrays humans as animals without any consequences for this. I also do not understand the director's opposition to religion and God. As if he just wanted to attract the attention of big companies. I suggest you watch Kaiji anime because it is really a masterpiece. .

I found that a little bit long and the players waffled on a bit with their personal stories. (I fast forwarded those parts).Bring on more games, less waffling on, and more strategic twists rather than the in depth story lines of the players involved.If you're bringing out a season 2, I'd love to see intense games that go for longer.

I think these VIPs just happened to be teaching English in Korea at the time and applied for some extra cash. The acting was horrible and severely cheapened the whole film. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series unfortunately. I can't recommend this film to family because the acting form the VIPs is just so embarrassing.NETFLIX - remove/replace the VIPs with real actors - budgets can't be that tight.

978,ChristopherNuin,Good idea but not original at all.,6/10,8 October 2021,"Idea was solid, but it was nothing new. There are plenty of movies about people getting killed or killing each other as part of a game for wealthy folks. VIPs ruined big portion of the last three episodes, they were a disaster. I don't understand why they went with some poor actors spitting lame lines in poor English, they could have introduce some serious Korean VIPs. Last episode was disappointing and the winner was known from the very first episode which made the game pointless to watch.

986,eldiankyo,Not bad but...,6/10,30 September 2021,"It's really similar to Battle Royale (book), or the movies Exam and Circle.I knew that 001 knows what's going on since the first episode. It was a mistake to give him the number 001. I thought he was the winner of a previous game, and he voted against the game at the beginning just to increase his chances (non-returning players).Huge mistake is to ""kill"" somebody when the camera is not showing them. (001 and the annoying woman both at the marble-game) Movie fans know the rule: If you don't see them die, they are not dead.Also at the marble game there was a plot hole, they could have win if the 2 players just swap bags. This way they both won the 10 marbles from their teammate, so they are both winning at the same time. (You don't have to own 20 marbles to win, the rule was just to win the marbles of your partner).In the last episode 001 says it was boring to watch these game he just wanted to play it - but there were documents from 1998 so he was bored for 20+ years? Interesting from a genius.I won't rewatch the series, but if there will be a second season, I'm in.

I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wastedThe show is only saved by the great acting.Never again.

991,Jari_V,"Very atmospheric show that has something for a wide audience, even when it is a bit predictable",9/10,12 October 2021,"The biggest feat of this show was the amazing cinematography and the atmosphere it created. From the depressing streets of urban Seoul and poor living quarters to the colorful staircases and luxurious decors of the 'game quarters', every detail in every scene creates a certain mood and fits in perfectly.The acting was a little inconsistent, while many of the lead actors were fantastic, some of the actors that got less screentime were well below their level. But as I said they got less screentime, thus the impact stays very limited to the series as a whole.As for the plot and its subplots, it is nothing completely new or unseen but certain elements to it make it an unique experience anyway. Even when the outcome and some of the twists were predictable they were still enjoying to watch, just because of the execution. Nonetheless the show still manages to surprise the viewer from time to time.Overall I really enjoyed the experience despite its minor flaws, it still manages to be a extremely tense, beautiful and intriguing show. It is for that reason that I am very curious to see how (or if?) the writers will continue after the open ending of the first season."

Theatrical. I know that in asia this is kinda normal, but you can't take it seriously.And the most important thing. Why would you copy the famous trade mark of la casa de papel?

998,prettytwitches,Phenomenal start...,7/10,6 October 2021,"Squid Game tells an intriguing story and is very compelling. It is somewhat disturbing, brutal and fantastical in its storytelling of the class divide in society. Nevertheless, once you start watching you won't be able to stop. Most of the episodes are fantastic and really draw you into the story. The character development and story arcs are pretty solid, and the acting is phenomenal. I was also blown away by the set design, costumes and overall aesthetic. However, there is some plot points that I was not overly fond of. One being the whole organ harvesting side story. I understand that this was here to highlight there was an intruder amongst them but for me it just distracted from the story and overall aesthetic of the show. Another was the 'twist' that Il Nam was behind the whole thing. I could see this a mile off but hoped that because the show had been clever so far it wouldn't fall into this trap. I was left feeling a bit deflated by the scene with him and Seong Gi-Hun at the end. There are also some plot holes that are somewhat frustrating. Like how was Il Nam phoning the Front Man to check in. Especially when some of the other contestants were staying awake all night. Also, when the Front Man goes to check out the washed-up body and finds his brother's badge. Wouldn't he have known that the body was not his brother? Still he goes back to the island like the issue had been handled. I do think that the show could have benefitted from maybe being 10 episodes as the last three feel somewhat rushed and different tonally from the rest of the show. I am also slightly frustrated that we did not find out more about the Front Man, this side of the story is somewhat lacking. I know a lot of people have taken issue with the VIPs acting. However, this did not bother me as it just added to the obnoxious and disgusting personality of these characters. Finally, you will be mystified by Seong Gi-Hun's hairstyle choice at the end, but I believe it is him trying 'start fresh' or trying to take back control of himself after what happened. Kind of like when people get crazy hairstyles after a bad breakup. You will definitely be frustrated by Sae-Byoek's death but again for me it just highlighted that none of the characters, no matter how badass, were in control of what was going to happen. Lastly, you may be annoyed by Seong Gi-Hun's final decision to not get on the plane. However, I think this is showing that he is no longer going to just sit by and watch bad things happen to other people. This is a narrative of his character throughout. We know that he has PTSD from the riots during the protest at his work. Where he sat by and watched someone get killed and again with the drunk guy on the street in the final episode. He could have gone down and helped the guy, but he didn't or maybe the show is just saying that people don't change. Seong Gi-Hun is impulsive. Whatever the reason it is a great Segway for the next season.

I would be much better if it was just a movie. I really don't understand why all this noise globally for this series. Maybe it's the splatter that new age likes?

If you are feeling bored because of repetitive ideas of Hollywood drama just watch Squid Game, the idea is just fresh in the packet, the actors are very capable, even the music is perfect.

1010,drkne,"Good, but not one of the best death game stories. How'd it get so popular?",7/10,9 October 2021,"I've loved death game stories ever since I started reading the Gantz manga back in the early 2000's. Or maybe I watched Battle Royale before that... not sure.I'm something of a gore hound, and enjoy the mixing and intersecting of various character arcs in these extreme situations. Seeing many hit both their bests and their worsts in a short period of time. Some have redemption arcs, some fall from grace and end in shame. It's almost always a fun rollercoaster of emotions.Personally I'd rank this somewhere around the middle of the list for this particular niche genre. I don't quite understand how this one in particular became so popular. I guess that a lot of young people think this is a new concept.As with most visual media I've seen come out of Korea, this has superb cinematography but imo, it falls short a bit in the writing and acting. I vastly prefer the similar Japanese incarnations that stretch all the way to the unflinching, insane (sometimes hoaky) extremes that really embed them in your memory.I didn't like most of the cast and only found 2 characters somewhat likeable, with the rest ranging from vaguely annoying to insufferably annoying. I didn't really find any of them actually relatable.Plus, who's idea was it to cover the face of the most famous (imo hottest) actor they have almost the whole time?! Won't spoil it by saying who.Off the top of my head, I would rank these above Squid Game: Battle Royale I and II, Gantz (manga and movies are good, the anime suuuucks because they made it too early before the first arc was finished in the manga), As the Gods Will, Alice in Borderland, King's Game (anime, haven't seen the movie)"
1011,majorasmask-53220,Eh,7/10,13 October 2021,"It was trying too hard to be artsy at times which resulted in it being boring in spots. Majority of it was predictable. My main issue was the reasoning behind all of the games. Yes, they are all in debt and need things paid off. Fair. So what is the reasoning for the mastermind to make all these people play games? He wanted to just have fun. This is lumped in with all the stupid reasons anime shows happen. Because of boredom or they just want to have fun/make things interesting. LAZY.

1017,favianioel-99408,lots of emotions,9/10,12 October 2021,"I watched the show because it was trending and I couldn't stop until I finished it. The idea behind the show is close to Hunger Games or Battle Royale, it's about a game where people die and there is friendship and betrayal, even if you watched hunger games and battle royale this is still new and a very beautiful show that is set apart.The progression of the characters was beautiful, the acting was very good some say the VIP acting and dialog was bad, I didn't like it either but I think the dialog was meant to be stupid and cheezy like real psychopath rich people would have, it's like a separation from normal people and rich people with a sick mind, so if the VIP disturbed you I think that was the director's plan.The show is pleasing to the eye and ears, even if the players were locked in a place every game was in a different setting and was beautifully designed, the tense music during the games makes you anxious, idk... just watch it already !!!"

By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching.

In episode 7, the VIPs are front and center, so that inevitably makes it the worst episode by far. This frustrates me even more, because this show was so close to being perfect.

Fantastic concept, brilliantly executed with some stellar acting and directing.But the English dub is.. laughably bad. The show drops from an 8/10 to a generous 5/10 when you watch it on the dub.Ignoring the atrocious acting from the English side of Squid Game, as soon as you switch it back to Korean, it instantly turn back into a beautiful piece of television, appealing to anyone aged 14 or over.An expert on cinema, or a bored Netflix subscriber with nothing else to do; both will enjoy it equally as this is one of the best shows Netflix has released. I would definitely recommend watching. It has some thrilling twists, fabulous performances from the Korean actors, and overall a great story. If you haven't yet - watch Squid Game. And watch it the way it was intended..."

The characters are all so distinct, not exactly very deep, but they get the job done and have shocking and powerful arcs. There were moments that made me cry, which I wasn't expecting. There was a point around the middle of the season where I was ready to call this the best TV show of the decade.And then the VIPs came in.Their acting was atrocious, like The-Room-level bad. I was scratching my head at how these guys were allowed on set. My only guess is there must be a language barrier that prevents the show's creators from being able to judge good acting in American dialogue. Not only did the VIPs break the immersion, they almost made the plot less interesting because by then the show started to delve into the sort of Hostel-esque depraved-rich-guys-watch-the-peasants-scuffle tropes.However, this didn't destroy the show for me, and I could have overlooked it. But then the show just sort of fell apart logically. First there was the glass hopscotch sort of game where I was just wondering throughout the entire thing: Why don't the contestants try to cling onto the frame of the platforms once they shatter? Why don't the contestants hold on to their shoes to chuck them at the platforms to see which are tempered glass and which aren't?And finally, Sae-Byeok, easily the most compelling character in the show, dies in the stupidest way possible. What was the point of her character development, particularly that incredible and poignant scene between her and the girl with the nose piercing? It angered me to see such a promising character die in such a dumb way. And maybe part of that is just a visceral reaction because she was my favorite character, but I feel like there was so much more potential and it all just fell flat, leaving the viewer feeling cheated by the build up. It's almost like the show said, ""Yeah we need to kill all the characters off quick 'cause, uh, finale's coming up, 'kay, let's get this over with.""Then what follows is a very unimpressive and cliche fight between Seong Gi-Hun and Mr. I'm-Completely-Selfish-Until-the-Plot-Demands-I-Sacrifice-Myself; followed by a kind of cool twist where Player 1 reveals he's not just alive but an undercover VIP the whole time (which is neat and all but really ruins what was one of my favorite scenes--the marble scene between him and Seong Gi-Hun); and then Seong Gi Hun becomes a strawberry and decides to, like, go rogue against the VIPs or something.I wouldn't have minded Sae-Byeok's death if it wasn't so rushed and anticlimactic. I wouldn't have minded any of this if it didn't literally counteract all the amazingness set up in the first half of the show. It's almost like two showrunners were fighting over the same concept.I still really did enjoy the good moments of the show, however, and I can't overstate that. I sat back in awe many times and said, ""This is one of the best scenes in TV history."" I will definitely rewatch the show, especially the first 6-ish episodes. There was never a moment (even when the season started getting bad) that I felt bored or disinterested. I feel like this show raises the bar for Netflix and I'm glad I watched it.I just also can't overstate how bad some of the decisions were. If it weren't for them, this would be the best show of the decade. And it still is a really good watch, if you're ready to suspend your disbelief quite a bit and okay with feeling slightly empty and frustrated by the end.

1033,ricardofilipedaraujo,Great show but disappointing ending,9/10,22 September 2021,"My score should be 8.5, but I will round it up.The bad:
Questionable ending which is suggesting a season 2VIPs acting and visit purposePolice substory is lacklusterThe good:
Well written and thrilling story inspired by multiple works in this genre, but piecing some of the best of each (Kaiji, Alice in Borderland, etc.)Different perspectives are brought to the table and the story allows the viewers to know a lot of the different characters.Original soundtrack matched the situation quite wellKR actors acting."

1036,kaldredpayne,Anime For People Who Haven't Watched Anime,9/10,3 October 2021,"This show is great so far. It has a cool mystery and style BUT the reason I believe it's so popular is because of its anime style concept. This show has an outlandish concept style that isn't popular in typical American media but is very popular in anime. I believe this show is so popular because everyone who loves anime likes the show. Not just that but those who have never seen anime because of stigma but would enjoy the medium LOVE this show because it's the first thing they have seen like it. Everyone is raving about this show because they have never seen anything like it (except for us anime watchers). I believe this show's popularity represents a huge shift in entertainment. I think this will be a gateway for it's fans into other non-American entertainment forms, most specifically anime.

1041,spirittaffy,Very Fun a great Binge,10/10,26 September 2021,"Here is why we wanted to say about Squid Game. I miss movies and shows like this. We haven't had anything similar for awhile. I thought the character development was top notch. I seriously cared about 8 characters. This made it fun because I had no idea who would die or win. All of the characters are flawed. There wasn't a typical hero or someone you really hated and I loved that. The acting was really really good for several characters. The directing and writing was really good. It was exciting and fun with lots of twists and turns. The concept was pretty cool and you could do sequels and it would be just as fun as long as you can find more actors as great as these. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will probably really like this series. My husband said it was a cross between Saw, Hunger Games and the minions (only for the outfits). I haven't seen Saw and don't like torture, but I enjoyed this. However, if you are not cool with lots of people dying you might think it's too much. Also, we all binged the season in two days and are still like wait a minute? I was thinking about this and wow, is this what really happened? Enjoy!"

1048,paytrader,Well done!,8/10,1 October 2021,"Many reviewers have commented on the ""horrible acting"" of the VIPs. I sense their lack of emotion is intentional. It is indicative of their lack of normal human empathy.Overall I found the story to be interesting and that the story compelled me to continue watching through to the end. In that regard, the production was well done.The conclusion and theme is not anything that I can praise however. Life is not purposeless nor is everyone bad and lacking in virtue. I have viewed so many Asian films that purport to say ""life is futile"".Life is worth living. Life has meaning. That is my hope and faith. So I stand against the theme of the production but I found it interesting and entertaining. Entertainment is its only value.

By the time VIPs arrive, the old man was killed playing marbles. In the last episode its revealed that old man wants to play and not host. Play what? He's already ""dead"" for the participants.Anyway, first couple of episodes were good and at multiple times the scenes were over stretched. Many elements and much of the build up was left hanging. The cop who chased the perpetrators the whole time, dies inconsequentially. No follow up on the messages sent to the cops (he even talked with his chief).Perhaps, the English translation and subtitles failed to deliver the story in true essence and that's why emotions and behaviors seemed unjustified.

Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying.

1056,smokiesfriend,VIP or Not VIP that is the question,10/10,29 September 2021,"I can't say this is a ""spoiler alert"" because everyone else is harping on the subject.Many people reviewing this series are hung up on how well the ""VIPs"" can act. Think of it another way, can they just be ordinary people whom just come on for a ""guest"" appearance? Do they actually have to act?Remember the ""rich"" people of the world are self centered and don't really care if one is injured or not. Why would they want to have lines that actually mean something?

1057,brooksayre,Great show but that one really annoying character,8/10,26 September 2021,"I have to write this, because I love the show. Interesting plot and executed pretty well. I also love how your able to be both sides. If this was like most shows and movies, the red people would be a mystery that you never get to know about, but I love how this dives into the red characters side too. Most of the show is great but, it's that stinking Korean girl, the one who talks loud and annoying, got banged by the one mob dude, and carries cigs around (I don't remember her name). I get the show needs to make annoying characters, but she's soooo annoying i literally can't stand her scenes in the show. Y'all didn't create a character that made it difficult for the other characters to get work with, you made a character difficult for the viewers of the show to watch the show. But other than that love the show.

1058,itsanamariahere,A whole nother level of deadly-game dramas,9/10,5 October 2021,"What makes Squid Game different from other dramas within the ""deadly games"" genre:1) The games are simple and easy to understand. If I were in Kakegurui or Liar Game, I wouldn't even fully understand the rules of the games, much less thing of an ingenious plan that takes advantage of god knows what loophole.2) The characters and situations are realistic. There is no cartoonish trope. They all behave like normal, average people, while still having their own unique personalities.3) There is no mastermind player with IQ 3000 who is always 11 steps ahead of the other characters.4) The characters chose to be part of the game even after its cruelty was unraveled, making it all the more disturbing.5) It put South Korea as a country in a bad light. I was shocked when Sae-Byeok basically said the South is not that much better than the North.My only complaint is that Squid Game doesn't escape the ""kill all the main characters except for the protagonist"" trope present in other k-dramas such as Sweet Home. Also, I feel like they could've expanded more on the relationship between Sae-Byeok and Ji-Yeong, building more on it before it all came crumbling to dust.

1062,tejw-34416,Beautiful and unpleasant,3/10,24 September 2021,"The Escher sets and the island hideaway that could have come from the Pinewood 007 stage are memorable but the programme is sunk by ithe moral vacuum at its core.SPOILERS ABOUND BELOW
Hundreds are despatched as so much deadwood so that we can have meaningful encounters with those granted speaking parts and they in turn dutifully expire so that the supposedly morally conflicted main character can feel a bit upset and buy off his complicity in the slaughter by chucking shedloads of his winnings at the sole dependent of one of the 400+ victims. Yes, he does look morose and affects appropriate hair growth to the point where he really must be saddened by the whole unpleasantness and even goes as far as having a salon dye his hair red (and do a terrible job at the rear - if you take away anything from this drama it is to ensure you get them to use a mirror to show you the back if you visit a barber in Korea).The contortions of probability required to support the reveal of the old man as the kingpin of the enterprise point to a rethinking of the physical world more radical than that proposed by Einstein and the logistics and financing of the operation are underpinned by no more than the fact that someone conceived of them in an idle moment and never troubled themselves to give it a second thought.The second series is a slam dunk but I'll follow the example of the few who chose not to return to the game - life outside may not always be a bed of roses but returning to the unpleasant stench of this narrative is a far worse proposition.

1065,bakryork,Bafflingly bad acting.,3/10,11 October 2021,"Nobody believes in themselves.More precisely, no actor seems to ever get out of their own head. Makes you wonder if it's all Korean actors, or just these particular Korean actors, who've never learned the art of losing themselves in their character. Every word, movement, expression is a reminder that you're watching actors in costumes on a set reciting lines in front of a camera.My suggestion: get a hold of the script and read it. In this way, I'm thinking, the story might have a chance to come alive-as something more than a series of sketches put on by a bunch of clowns.

1067,acplegalsuite,A masterpiece. Gore is secondary.,10/10,10 October 2021,"You can't compare this show to Battle Royale, Saw, Kill Bill, Hostel, Hunger Games. No way.READ ON.Hunger Games - which was made so cheesy, even the name 'Katnis Evergreen' is so Cringey for the genre is NOTHING like Squid Game. I learn nothing from Hunger Games and the acting/emotions of the characters are not believable. The contestants are too polished without any flair to project a torturous situation - mental and physical. The whole picture is a clown fest and the moment the contestants are unleashed to battle for survival, the show turned from boring to purposeless. I felt nothing from the show. Other brutal shows above are all about senseless killings too. If at all comparing the above shows, Squid Game is perhaps closest to Saw, of which the latter has quite an interesting concept but still boring.Does not mean you release a film about plane crash, you own the genre. SQUID GAME is an ORIGINAL survival show and Hollywood just have to admit it.Also, SQUID GAME is at a complete different skill level, in terms of performance and writing. The character development is genius, and the planting of clues and planned coincidences is mind blowing. The gore is just secondary, and the whole heart of the show is completely something else - next level entertainment.Watching this show inspires me to be compassionate, and I am not inspired at all by the violence. Those who wishes not to see the show just because it's rated to include violent scenes, will just be at loss."

I've recently seen it compared to Alice In Borderland and I must say Squid Game is far superior for the storyline, character development and eerie message of what lengths human beings will go to for money when feeling desperate.The only moment I questioned the show was during the first half of episode 2 which slowed down a bit but picked up again within the second half.After that I was glued to it and by the end I was left hoping for a season 2.

1071,colinandmartin,Episodes 1-6 were great. The rest weren't,8/10,5 October 2021,"The first 6 episodes had me questioning whether this show was a masterpiece and one of Netflix's best pieces. Everything from the acting to the cinematography to the writing was incredible and really dragged u into this world in which there was no escape. And then I watched episode 7. The VIPs were awful and served no purpose to the story what so ever and seemed like a waste of time with cringe humour and simply bad acting. The episode 7 game was also taken straight from ""kaiji"" an anime. They attempted to cram so many plot twits and turns to the point where it wore down the finale so much it was boring to watch. The main plot twist was incredibly predictable and honestly if it had a simpler ending it would be an easy 10/10 and one of the best Netflix shows they've put out ever. I do recommend it but by the end you don't really care about the lead character and it just feels odd (not in a good way). This show was so close to being an absolute bombardment of genius tv show making but the last few episodes took that title away. All in all a solid show but just a bad ending. It doesn't ruin the show it's just annoying to see such a brilliant show take such an awful ending."
1072,wcddg,Really great show with a few minor hiccups..,9/10,6 October 2021,"I loved the show and binged it through in one night. Great acting of the main characters. So all in all a great show, that was very emotional at times and had me on the edge of my seat. The show plays with a lot of moral dilemmas as well as drawing a critical portrait of the structural injustices of late capitalism, as well as the arrogance and misanthrophy of the super rich.Only a couple things in the plot were a bit sloppy / confusing:1) The cop - he manages to get in there and move around unseen for that long with cameras everywhere? When he's alone with the VIP and leaves him unconscious and naked - how on earth does that not bother / alarm the other VIPs? Shouldn't they be up in arms? And then his missing brother is actually working as a sort of head operator for the game despite only being missing for a short while? Why does the brother shoot him dead off that cliff, literal seconds after telling him he wouldn't do that and after telling his men to bring him in alive? Seemed so pointless. So many questionmarks and I feel there was room to play it out differently.2) The way the players behaved during the game. It was abundantly clear that this was a ""winner takes it all"" scenario, meaning only one would get out alive and win the prize. What on earth was going on with all the bonding and trying to ""get out together""? And then in the next moment they were all over each other killing each other with their bare hands over some missed food rations. It did add to the drama and definitely worked for the character development, but this seemed a bit random.3) The vote / return to the game. When they first voted to end the game, the old guy actually decided the vote with his vote. Why on earth would he do that. Just to motivate the players by going back to their old lives, to come back on their own accord? Seems an awful lot of extra risk and effort, having all these people back in the real world after the atrocities they have just witnessed. Also he had shared with the other players that he had a brain tumor and was dying, it would have made all the sense in the world, had he chosen to continue.Then they said: we will split the money among the families of the deceased. When the players returned, the money was still there.3) The VIPs poor / clichée acting and demeanor. Maybe it was actually intended, as the whole show is a parable for the injustices of late capitalism, which then again, apparently went over so many heads that it's not even funny anymore. ""They were there voluntarily, right?"" ""See what bad choices lead to?"" - No, it's a structural problem that made these people so desperate that a life and death murder game seemed like the more viable option than trying their best in the free world. How anyone can see that as their own fault and not see how the system is designed to exploit the vast majority of people into debt slavery while the 1% are so bored they literally start killing people for fun - well that is entirely beyond me. I wish more people would understand this not-so-subtle subtext of the show.4) The prize. I was actually surprised the winner even got the prize money in the end (and apparently there are no tax authorities in south korea) and they let him go, knowing what he knows. But even more surprising: Did the main character not have 4 million debt with some gangsters who were out for his blood? How could he have ""gone back to his old life"" in his neighbourhood for a full year - and not have touched the prize money - without at least paying off his debt?Still loved it.

1073,mayaajey,It was really good!,8/10,27 September 2021,"It was a very good series, I really enjoyed it! I do like this type of genre so I was looking forward to watch it! I think that the plot was entertaining and I also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as Money Heist (the guys wearing red suits) or Star Wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like Darth Vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which I didn't mind. I also noticed that the series is pretty similar to Hunger Games and Alice in Borderland on different aspects but I still find it unique and interesting. I didn't mind the VIP acting tbh, I've seen worse and that was ok. However there is one thing that I would have changed. I would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and I guess more 'bossy'. Idk but I felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. I remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) Are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? It just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. That's my opinion tho, It's not that big of a deal. The rest was good!Again I liked the plot, I liked the characters and the writing was good. Yes there are things that I didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? Just like that?? What was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? And there is moreHowever I did enjoy the series and I can't wait for the next season.

1074,ba-80642,Finale kinda ruined it for me,8/10,10 October 2021,"Up to Episode 6 This show was near perfect, every aspect of it was extremely enjoyable, the pacing kept you hooked while not making everything feel unnatural, the acting was realistic and everyone really stayed true to their character, the filming was really enjoyable and it gave you a great way to see stuff, then with episode 7, they introduced american vips, now don't get me wrong they definitely didn't have good acting, but i will give them credit for really being emotionless and portraying what kind of people they are supposed to be, plus they didn't take much from the plot so i didn't care too much for them, and finally the 5th game on the 7th episode was arguably my favorite, so i enjoyed that too, episode 8 wasn't bad in terms of anything but plotting, you follow up with the cop the entire show just for him to be killed by his brother who is for some reason the front man who also won the game a few years back, it really doesn't make sense, doesn't add to the show, and doesn't have a backstory to rest on, but again that's kind of a side story which shouldn't interfere with the main story and the main character's story, so the finale must be great? Right? Not really, the finale starts off okay with the final game but the writing feels extremely off, everyone breaks character, there isn't much story progression, and the worst thing, the old man is behind it all, for some reason the old man (001) is the one who started and made the game because he was too rich, this would've been an okay story if he didn't take part in the game and have his character built off being a poor old man risking it all, because he wouldn't actually die, we also see the main character ( assumably ) try to seek revenge instead of going to get custody of his daughter, which's a major way for Netflix to milk the show by leaving it on a cliffhanger and probably making a second season, i hope they can find a way to make the second season somehow good, but there isn't much to do, he'll just, seek revenge? Then it's over, nothing else to do, other than get his life back in order, which should've been part of the finale, however i have to give credit to this show for consistently having great acting and filming, which's why i think it deserves an 8 regardless of the abysmal choices they took after episode 6.

1076,shelovesme-43178,Way too good,10/10,18 September 2021,"I loved the way the entire drama revolves around the true nature of humans. At every stage this drama never stops to surprise you. Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.I want to remove my memories and watch this again.

1077,villarosie,Had me hooked from the start!,10/10,21 September 2021,"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors.

1080,awfilmmaker,Captivating throughout! Never a dull moment,8/10,24 September 2021,"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended."

1084,elystonhayden-19893,Binged! Please don't remake and ruin,8/10,21 September 2021,"Best Netflix show I've seen for awhile. Had echoes of Spanish film The Platform (2019) and of course The Hunger Games films.Hard on their luck people pushed down and controlled by the top feeders of society, are approached to play a game to win the big bucks and get out of the current holes they have found themselves in.And what a thrilling edge of your seat ride this makes for viewing. Unknown masked dictators are hosting a game-show of sorts were the players (In debt everyday people) are desperate to win the cash even if it costs them their lives.Lots of twists and some deeper observations on humanity follow. Just a warning it's very violent and a bit trippy, so if that's not your thang obvs avoid. It also reminded me of the human sport elements in Eli Roth's Hostel and James Wan's Saw franchise so yes it's out there.Will become a future cult classic and Korean cinema is having a golden moment after masterpieces like Parasite and The Handmaid. Squid Game's hyper realism is pretty visionary stuff for Netflix's typically bland output. Fly me to the moon 8/10.

1086,jimmyliaiesecscau,"Redundant conversations, buggy plots",6/10,11 October 2021,"Watched this tv show cos It's well-received recently, but I don't find it really captivating and engrossing for some reason.1. The whole story is proceeding at a very slow pace, and there's too much redundant conversation between characters that provide no important information. Personally speaking, I prefer shows with shortcut conversations that either give out information for the latter episodes or are necessary for portraying the characters.2. illogical and buggy sometimes. In the beginning, it states like the money will accumulate as people die, and 1 person equals 10 million South Korean won, but how come the leading actor receives 456 won while only 455 died? I don't get it.

1094,deborayim,Ppl complaining about VIPs are hilarious to me,10/10,29 September 2021,"All these caucasians complaining about the VIPs about their accent or their oddly scripted lines are hilarious to me. I mean hollywood has been doing this to asians for decades, guess everyone feels weird now that it is happening in reverse. For example, Hiring different asian person to play a specific role about a specific asian nationality, hiring white ppl to play asian characters. Not even really learning the correct language or bother to learn the correct pronunciations of their lines. Or even write them a proper line in their own language in a show or a movie. Or forcing asian actors to have an asian accent when the said actor does not actually have one. I guess decades of watching random ppl portraying asians in some gibberish accent has always made me cringe. Now everyone gets to experience it as well hahaha.

1097,noahfawbush,Barely fell short of being a masterpiece,8/10,30 September 2021,"To start, I can confidently say that Squid Game is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. The plot is near perfectly done, the games keep you on the edge of your seat, and the characters are entertaining. There's not many negative things I can say about Squid Game, but there are 3 main gripes that bothered me the whole way through:1.) The characters are naive. Through the game, players often teamed up and vowed that they would win the game together and split the money. However, the game master made it clearly known that there could only be one winner, yet the characters keep making plans to win the game together.2.) The VIP actors are some of the worst I've ever seen. Their acting was so atrocious, it made the movie feel less like a dark, twisted thriller and more of a parody. What few moments they were on the screen warrants removing a star by itself.3.) Gi-Hun won the game for no reason. After winning the final challenge and ultimately watching his best friend die in the process, Gi-Hun is returned to his home town with the enormous cash prize. He doesn't touch the money and spends an entire year getting drunk. When he finally comes back to his senses and decides to go see his daughter, he learns that the game is still alive and we're left with the inclination that he'll try to end it in the predictable season 2. (The red hair was stupid too)Overall, the series was well done and binge worthy without a doubt. I just hope they don't ruin Squid Game's legacy by putting out a disappointing sequel series.

I watch it the end btw. The story line was also stupid. It was only popular Bcz the actors and the actresses r pretty and all. It's basically abt playing a game for 45.6 billion dollars and if u join the game u can't quit. And if u quit u will be eliminated. And if u don't follow the game rules u will be eliminated too. Eliminated means u will get shot by these guys from the game and they don't show their identity and hide behind the mask. So umm yea there r sm other k dramas who deserve more hype like the penthouse, hotel del luna, sweet home etc.

There r sm k dramas that deserve more hype like sweet home, the penthouse, hotel del luna etc.

The show had great twists and made me kinda sad but there was one problem... the vip's. They were so cringey and the dub for the show in general was hilariously awful. But apart from that, I recommend it greatly.

You can tell that a lot was put into this show and it just drew me in even more.

1112,queenhiyahiya,Confusing drama like this can get an award?,5/10,12 October 2021,"Drama seems exaggerated, I don't know what is discussed here. Comedy, action, betrayal and sex elements put together so I'm confused about which genre to focus on first. It's a mess to be honest.The drama is rather predictable, there is an element of surprise in this drama but not all of it.I loved episode 7, it's really cool. But nothing else, because I don't think so. How can acting and dramas like this become a historical drama netflik in 83 countries can even be called worldwide history.But this story can show some addictive scenes, I like it. Watching this is addictive, and makes me curious at least.

I think Netflix users are really desperately waiting a good serie and when they find ""not terrible one"" , they think it is great. For sure we can't deny the quality of acting of main characters (not all) also should int be denied some parts of scenario was like written by a high school teenager.Let's say ""it was not a waste of time"" but i don't think anyone will wstch over and over again. Just a one night stand serie.

1114,RealityGal,Wow! Jaw dropping scenes left and right. 👍🏼,9/10,30 September 2021,"This Korean series was brilliant and quite shocking in so many ways. It has lots of very unique violent scenes that at times I found myself stunned for a moment but loving every second of how this show pulls you in. You can really feel for so many of the characters and I found myself really rooting for my favorites but knowing in the back of my head that they will all probably die in this crazy life or death game one after another until it reaches the winner. Episode 6 Gganbu is so mind blowing and heartbreaking. I'm sincerely hoping we get a season 2. We need more squid games minus the ridiculous VIP's or at least get them to speak like an actual human being would. Geez! That is the only reason I didn't give this rating a 9.

1116,frankyvertriest,Not worth the hype: sloppy characters,7/10,13 October 2021,"It was fun to watch, had some unexpected games, except of course for the squid game in the end. We all saw that one coming, right?The thing that bothers me the most is the lack of character development... I don't understand the main character. He exactly knows what he gets into when he re-enters the game. Still he is frozen all the time with guilt and pity. When he wins, he does nothing with the money for a year? He keeps on neglecting his daughter, and the little orphan brother till the bizar Christmas scene in the end.. Next season he will go jack Bauer on their asses..The show was full of sloppy characters like 'Han Mi-nyeo': the lady from the sex scene. I didn't care about her at all, but she was one of the most interesting characters. She would do anything to survive: fuck, kill, smuggle,... What made her like that? The fact that she committed suicide (something completely against her instincts), could have been an amazing moment, but it was not..

1118,mvanlaerhoven,Original and creative; go watch it!,9/10,29 September 2021,"I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it."

1130,Goriz43,Excellent Series - Bad ending,9/10,5 October 2021,"Loved the series, so many good things coming out from Korea lately. Really loved the first six episodes which were fantastic. However last three episodes and as many others have mentioned the VIPs were terrible.I never understood if the cop died, because he was only shot in the shoulder?Also, why wouldn't he use the money in the end hahaha, didn't he have loan sharks after him??I like the fact though that it didn't get a Hollywood ending. All in all, well done Korean television! Keep it up and we can get rid of the shifty Hollywood crappy American stuff once and for all.

It make you feel like you are part of the squid game while watching. It will definitely leave you guessing who will survive in the end. I absolutely love HoYeon Jung acting, she's really tough, really cute and beautiful all around. I loved HoYeon Jung character, she kept to herself, strong minded, didn't trust anyone and I love her serious image. She was really amazing! I wish HoYeon Jung could stay for more seasons but unfortunately she died towards the end and I was really upset about it! It was really sad. Keep it coming for more seasons.

Grabbing you and keeping you hooked until episode 3-4 and the true purpose of the game and show started to dwindle. I wish they stuck to the rules and had more games to focus on. Wasnt as intriguing watching them very un-cinematic-like kill each other off. A show that had so much potential fell just short due to poor writing.

I don't know if they watch a wrongly translated version or what but the version i watch they are told they all can win the prize as long as they finish the 6 games.I also get that the VIPs acting and ""intonation"" suck, but keep in mind this is a korean show so why would they accurately portrait americans?Show is amazing, main characters acting is superb and music is very good.

1142,vasso-ierem,Very interesting but weak ending,7/10,25 September 2021,"It is the first Korean TV series I watched. I found it very interesting, with fast action. It also gives you food for thought. Unlike series of similar cases, it has the main difference that the players are there voluntarily. This creates different dynamics and plot. Watching the first 6 episodes I was excited. From the 7th episode until the end, there was no surprise and everything was predictable.The explanation of why all this happened,was just what was expected. The story with the policeman and his brother, did not finally seem to have special meaning. The ""plot twist"" with the old man, was not a plot twist at all, if you have watched ""Saw' 1 & 2 and many of the thrillers that followed it. Perfect up to a point, but without a climax. This could have been a 10 but..

It's very distracting and can take away the seriousness of the show at times.Its so good. So amazing. Loved it to pieces. Each episode left me wanting more. But then to keep from going through the show too quick I limited myself to two episodes a day.Totally worth it as waiting 24 hours between every 2 episodes really added to the suspense of the show.Highly recommend.

""The Most Dangerous Game"" ""The Game."" Did you notice many of the movie's scenes resembled kill rooms similar to those leaked during Clinton and Podesta's #pizzagate? So ask yourself, why this soft disclosure movie full of kids' games, toys, color, and imagery? What kind of people are REALLY directing ""The Game"" and who are the INNOCENTS forced to play? This series is once again attempting to disclose the same sickness Kubrick did and was killed for in ""Eyes Wide Shut""!

1147,kenaigonzalez,Best Show of 2021 🐙,9/10,5 October 2021,"Squid Game is a roller coaster from start to finish! I had no expectations going in and left captivated by the world created - I'm already ready for Season 2.The show is filled with all kinds of twists and turns. The plot is wonderfully planned out with lots of foreshadowing and hints toward the future, but just enough to keep you guessing. I was literally on the edge of my seat for episodes 4, 5, and 6.The masterful use of color paired with the cinematography made it a joy to watch, and the somber music really drew you in.The real big takeaway from this show, though, was the character-driven story. All the actors from the leads to the extras were phenomenal, and I hope to see many members of the ensemble in future projects. Jung Ho-yeon absolutely crushes her first big acting role - keep an eye out for her in the future!A must watch in 2021."

1150,hopelorinn,Frustrating...,5/10,2 October 2021,"I really think this show could have been great. The plot, the attention to detail... all spot on. The dialogue however, is SO juvenile. It's like sitting around the table with a bunch of middle schoolers. The voice over acting itself is obviously horrid, but the dialogue is what kills it. From what I understand from a previous review from someone who speaks both fluent Korean and English, it was not translated well at all.It's so disappointing that the writers, directors, and actors put so much heart and soul in to this, only for the dialogue to be lazily translated and acted. Shame on Netflix for dropping the ball here.

It was presented in a movie called 13 in 2010 but it was a Russian Roulette game rather than kids' games. I enjoyed the show but didn't feel it's worth the hype that people have made about it. Anyway if you haven't watched it, please do if you enjoy psychotic movies like American Psycho and The Game.

1156,perlonizer,"Would have been a cool series maybe, if...",5/10,7 October 2021,"... they didn't try to include a moral story. I really liked the look of the series and all the locations in it. There was a lot of potential to tell a story with an unique vibe. But besides of the fact that most parts of the storyline were predictable (it often felt like the series was produced for people who never watched a series before), it is not very profound or smart of the main character that he agrees to participate in a game to kill other people for money in the first place, and in the following days he notices that it was a cruel thing to do. One year later he even played a game again while risking that a homeless person freezes to death. Looks like he didn't learn a lot.

1157,boxigor,Recycled ideas all over the place,3/10,13 October 2021,"The series is a collection of second-hand ideas, characters and plots collected from all over the place - starting from a Japanese movie 'Shinkansen daibakuha' about desperate workers finishing with a Russian movie 'New Land' about letting prisoners manage themselves. Not to mention dozens of survive-for-money US movies such as recent 'Escape Room'.The only reason this series seems to appeal to Netflix auditorium is because it's Korean, so entourage and decorations look fresh and new.

1163,mojavecali,It's great but,7/10,2 October 2021,"So gambling, is bad, I try not to bet much only when I did decide to pick Green Bay for 50 and Chiefs for 50 and get 130 back because Green Bay loss... and I could've gotten another 160. So you see, gambling isn't good😂. Anyways the main theme of this show is in Korea people struggle. And everyone's life's suck ass.The show follows this guy who just won big in Horse racing and gets picked pocketed and loan Sharks come after him and then meets a stalker business man. They play ddakji. This a game where you have to flip the paper on the ground, and the main character loses and in exchanged gets slapped to lose 100,000 wons from the debt count. And so he walks away with 200,000 wons. And so he returns home and his mom is upset because he looks brutally beaten up. Anyways he has the card from the business man and goes to where he'll be picked up and enter the game: Squid game duh duh duh. Also he's number 456. And so he learns they're gonna play the worse twisted Saw like games that are children games basically- Red light/Green Light, Honey comb cutting out the cookie, marbles, tug of war, squid game and hop starch(on glass bridge). The show is so detailed and has so many good ideas that I really over look the cliques, the plot armor and plot conveniences. The twist I have to say I saw coming because it's obvious, as I watch so many movies I saw many things coming. And I love the music score, the best I've heard in a while. The editing so top notch, the violence is not that bad, everyone complaining hasn't watched Saw. This is funny and it's not in bad spirit tbh, like it has meaning. And the acting of you go from English over the Korean actors to subtitles is pretty good. I like how unique this show is even tho I've seen Hunger games and Battle royal and Saw. This is the best out of them, the child games they play is hilarious and I love it all, I didn't see what was coming but I wanted Tag or Red rover or spear the queer lmao. But this show is so heart warming so energized and so horror I like it a lot. I'll give it a B+, the only bad thing is sometimes some of the subplots are nonsense and the cop is annoying, and the VIPs suck ass. But beside that I love this show. Watch it!!!

1166,Dionice,Overrated but okay.,8/10,12 October 2021,"I feel like the show's overrated. There were too many holes in the story IMO. First of all, does the battery on that officer's phone ever run out? Secondly, how do people go missing (and not just one, but more than 400 each time) and nobody finds out anything? And they have been running the games for years now, so, it is pretty unrealistic. In addition, don't people get flagged for having all that money suddenly in their bank accounts? However, the overall idea of show was something new and exciting. It is worth watching, but there are far better shows out there.

1168,eagle_eyes2,Show Adds Morals and Is Captivating,8/10,26 September 2021,"I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.

1170,silencial,Good but very predictable,6/10,2 October 2021,"Given the hype of this series, I caved and started watching it. I've seen Alice in Borderland before and loved that one. Squid Game feels a little like a bit of copy and mix of different already existing content, they even use the Battle Royal music to announce games :D That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this series, it was good but quite slow and so extremely predictable. Be it that I'm used to watching thrillers and horror movies, but I wasn't really surprised by any of the revelations.I'd be happy if it finishes here, anything else would just be a repetition anyway.Good watch if you're bored. Does it live up to the hype? Definitely not, no idea why it's being so overhyped.

1171,johncvw,Great and somewhat disturbing but you can't stop watching it,7/10,9 October 2021,"I watched all 9 episodes over 3 days. The 8th episode started to be somewhat dull and lacked the excitement of the others. However the 9th and final episode was a complete disaster and almost unwatchable. The 10 minute explanation of the games given by and old man was so painful and extremely boring to watch. There were so so many unanswered questions, very boring and uninspiring dialog and acting, no cliffhanger to make you not really care if there is another series.

Started off well but has a huge decline once the series starts progressing.I don't understand why people are praising this series. One can even skip it and not worry about missing a lot.People don't have their own opinion these days. If their friends like something then they gotta praise it as well and that's what happened to this series. Some people started praising it and everyone followed the train.Don't waste your time on this. Better move on and watch something else.

I was definitely expecting an explanation for why the game was made and I got it, but it was pretty lukewarm and not convincing. Some of the characters are also quite poorly portrayed and processed. The acting at times seemed artificial to me. The series it is not bad, but it is definitely a overrated.

1177,emillassen-81983,Did we all watch the same show?,3/10,30 September 2021,"The main character cannot act to save his life. I found myself not caring for most of the characters, so the emotional scenes and the supposed suspense during the games fell flat.I was hoping for some inventive games, but that wasn't the concept I suppose.I've watched a lot of terrible netflix shows, but I couldn't even finish this one. I stopped before the VIP episode, which people seems to be very angry about, so I don't count that towards my rating of 3 stars.I honestly don't understand how some people can rate this 9/10. I get 10/10, because some people get excited easily and want to improve the score of a show they like, but 8 or 9/10 seems to suggest that it's one of the better shows of the year, and that those people actually thought about their ratings. I don't get it, man."

Other than that another masterpiece by koreans, loved it from start to end.

1179,wielandmd-05443,Dissapointing,3/10,14 October 2021,"I really don't understand the high ratings and all the media hype. Very shallow , simple and predictable storyline, horrible (over) acting (with the exception of Jung Hoyoen) and too many loose ends. Camera work is average at best and props are a joke. This could well have been a school project for students. From all the fuzz in the media I had expected much more.

1180,austingarcia-71282,Amazing until the end,6/10,2 October 2021,"It's nail biting the entire time and I'm the end you don't get to see who the VIPs are, you don't get to see the one VIP explain what it is, you don't get to see anything the police officer gathered, you don't know how the police officers brother became the front man, he tries to save a man that killed all of his friends in the end, the old guy doesn't ever get to the point in what he's saying to the point where it's frustrating, and he never goes to see his kid with all the money. He did help the girls little brother though that's the only good thing about the end.

1182,marc_potgieter-17528,Well worth watching,8/10,20 September 2021,"Wife and I really enjoyed the series. The storyline and acting was great.The only thing I would fault it on is the foreigners in the show. The Korean actors were top notch and believable.... while the vips just seemed like they found random foreigners in Seoul to play the characters. Even Abi seemed a bit strange at times.

1184,sakellarimar,I couldn't stop watching till the END!,10/10,2 October 2021,"I loved this show!! I wish I could forget it and just watch it for the first time again! It stays in your mind for a while, the concept was insane and cruel.. The manipulation was the real game! They knew exactly how the instincts of the players will work each time.I felt sorry for like everyone in the finale, but I liked the way he fixed the ""family issues"" with the little boy and the old lady!
