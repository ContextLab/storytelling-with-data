Project Name: Antisemitic and White Supremacy Incidents in New Hampshire 2018-2021
Authors: Emily Appenzeller ’22 (@emilyapp2), Allison Wachen ’22 (@allisonwachen) 

### Overview
This is where you describe what your project is about, in a few sentences. Specifically:
What was your main question?
How did you approach exploring and/or answering your question?
What data did you use?
What sorts of data science tools did you use?
What did you find or accomplish (be brief)? For example, did you find any interesting results or insights? Or did you solve an interesting problem that might be useful in another project?
Upload a movie of your data story to YouTube and include a link here. You can narrate over a screencast of you scrolling through your notebook, or you can paste your figures into a Powerpoint or Keynote presentation (or similar). You may also find Marp useful; it's what I'm using to generate the slideshows for Modules 1--4. (Sample slides here and here.)

### Question
The recent antisemitic and white supremacy incidents at Dartmouth made us interested in exploring the incidence of these incidents in New Hampshire over time. This information helps us better understand the likelihood that antisemitic and white supremacy incidents would occur at Dartmouth and other towns in New Hampshire in the near future.

### Approach
We used data from the Anti-Defamation League’s HEAT Map. We looked at white supremacy and propaganda and antisemitic incidents from 2018-2021 in New Hampshire. We used Python, Pandas, and Plotly.

### Findings Summary
The number of white supremacy incidents has increased over time at a higher rate than the number of antisemitic incidents. Looking at school incidents, we found a similar percentage of antisemitic and white supremacy incidents targeted at higher education institutions: Dartmouth and other higher education institutions have a similar likelihood of being targets of both incidents. However, K-12 schools are more likely to be targets of antisemitic incidents.
We found a strong, positive correlation (.645) between white supremacy and antisemitic incidents meaning that areas with white supremacy incidents are more likely to have also experienced antisemitic incidents. Many of the white supremacy incidents were committed by antisemitic groups, and similarly, many antisemitic incidents were perpetrated by white supremacists. This relationship is consistent with the ADL’s national findings that nearly half of harassment antisemitic incidents were perpetrated by white supremacy groups. Among white supremacy incidents, 28.9% were committed by Neo-Nazi groups. Among anti-semitic incidents, 14.3% were perpetrated by white supremacists
With this information in mind, Dartmouth, other universities, and K-12 schools throughout the state should entertain the possibility of future antisemitic and white supremacy incidents occurring. They can teach students how to report and handle such incidents with programs, training, and resources offered by the Anti-Defamation League.
Future projects could look at the other data sets in our future directions section of our notebook:
Data to Consider in Future Analysis:
FBI Hate Crime for US and NH
Relationship Between Hate Crime Laws by State and # of Hate Crimes
Relationship Between Antisemitic Incidents per State and Jewish Population Per State

### Downloading the data
Provide a link to the dataset(s) you're using for the project, along with a brief description of the data.
https://www.adl.org/education-and-resources/resource-knowledge-base/adl-heat-map 
This provides data on the number of white supremacy and propoganda and antisemitic incidents in NH from 2018-2021. 

### Running the code
Describe, in sufficient detail for a new person (moderately competent but unfamiliar with your work) to follow, how to run your code. If the project is implemented in one or more Colaboratory notebooks, you should provide a link to the notebook(s) here. Also copy the notebooks (as .ipynb files) into your project folder so that everything related to your project is backed up on GitHub.

Contributing to the code
Tell other people how they can contribute to the project you've started. Specifically:
What are the most obvious next steps?
What are some questions that your work raises?
What challenges remain?
Are there any known bugs or problems with your approach that someone continuing your project should be aware of?

### Future Directions:
Data to Consider in Future Analysis (the data is in the notebook):
FBI Hate Crime for US and NH
Relationship Between Hate Crime Laws by State and # of Hate Crimes
Relationship Between Antisemitic Incidents per State and Jewish Population Per State

### Acknowledgements
If your idea is based on or inspired by someone else's work (either their code or their ideas), cite them and provide links to their work. Also, if you received help or support from someone who is not listed as an author on this project, you should acknowledge them here.
